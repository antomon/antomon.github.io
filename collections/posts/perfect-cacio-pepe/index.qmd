description: "Who would have thought that *Cacio e Pepe*, the beloved Roman dish of pecorino cheese, pepper, and pasta, could become the subject of highbrow scientific inquiry? Yet here we are, with physicists meticulously analyzing cheese clumps and starch behavior to solve humanity's most pressing culinary mystery: how to make the sauce creamy without transforming it into a mozzarella-like disaster."

**Preprint review**: This paper is proof that no aspect of life is too small to overanalyze with the full force of science. Armed with phase diagrams and free-energy models, the authors have waged war on clumpy pasta sauce‚Äîand won. It‚Äôs a gloriously nerdy deep dive into the thermodynamics of Italian cuisine, with the bonus of a scientifically engineered *Cacio e Pepe* recipe for when your inner nonna fails you. A must-read for anyone who‚Äôs ever overthought their dinner.

- The harrowing tale of the ‚Äúmozzarella phase,‚Äù where cheese proteins band together to ruin your meal.  
- Why starch is the unsung hero of creamy sauces, and how to wield its powers like a culinary sorcerer.  
- How to impress friends with pasta and casual mentions of binodal phase separation.  

Prepare to be simultaneously amused, educated, and slightly bewildered by this heroic effort to quantify deliciousness.
