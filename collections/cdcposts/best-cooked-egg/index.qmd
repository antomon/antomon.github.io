description: "This paper takes the seemingly mundane task of cooking an egg and transforms it into a scientific endeavor worthy of computational fluid dynamics modeling. The researchers introduce \"periodic cooking,\" a method involving alternating hot and cold water baths to achieve optimal yolk and albumen textures without separation. Utilizing a suite of high-tech analysis techniquesâ€”including Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonanceâ€”the authors validate that their method enhances both texture and nutritional quality. While the real-world practicality of the method remains questionable, the paper highlights the intersection of engineering and culinary science, proving that even breakfast can be overanalyzed."

## Scientific article

> **Title**: Periodic cooking of eggs
>
> **Authors:**  Emilia Di Lorenzo, Francesca Romano, Lidia Ciriaco, Nunzia Iaccarino, Luana Izzo, Antonio Randazzo, Pellegrino Musto & Ernesto Di Maio
> 
> **Abstract**: Egg cooks are challenged by the two-phase structure: albumen and yolk require two cooking temperatures. Separation or a compromise temperature to the detriment of food safety or taste preference are the options. In the present article, we find that it is possible to cook albumen and yolk at two temperatures without separation by using periodic boundary conditions in the energy transport problem. Through mathematical modeling and subsequent simulation, we are able to design the novel cooking method, namely periodic cooking. Comparison with established egg cooking procedures through a plethora of characterization techniques, including Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy, confirms the different cooking extents and the different variations in protein denaturation with the novel approach. The method not only optimizes egg texture and nutrients, but also holds promise for innovative culinary applications and materials treatment.

## Review

There are those who push the boundaries of human knowledgeâ€”exploring the cosmos, unraveling the mysteries of quantum mechanics, or curing disease. And then there are those who, armed with computational fluid dynamics software and a dream, dedicate themselves to solving the age-old conundrum of egg cooking.

Ladies and gentlemen, science has finally done it: periodic egg cooking.

If you ever found yourself lying awake at night, haunted by the knowledge that egg whites and yolks require different cooking temperatures but didnâ€™t want to face the barbarity of cracking an egg into a pan, worry no more. Di Lorenzo et al. have blessed us with a solution so elegantly complex that it makes the Hadron Collider look like a childâ€™s toy.

### Methodology: or, how to overcomplicate breakfast

The authors introduce the concept of "periodic boundary conditions"â€”which, if you assumed was a theory reserved for quantum mechanics, youâ€™d be mistaken. Apparently, the same principles that guide subatomic particles can be applied to your Sunday brunch. By dunking eggs repeatedly in hot and cold water, one achieves the seemingly impossible: a yolk at 67Â°C and an albumen at 85Â°C, without separation. Revolutionary. Itâ€™s unclear if the process also requires a synchronized swimming routine, but I wouldnâ€™t be surprised.

The team employed a dazzling array of techniquesâ€”Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry. Because, as we all know, breakfast isnâ€™t truly complete without a spectroscopic deep dive into the molecular nuances of your omelet.

### Findings: the egg-stential revelation

Through meticulous experimentation, the researchers confirm what every Michelin-starred chef and every grandmother with a stovetop has known for centuries: cooking time and temperature affect texture. Astonishing.

But letâ€™s not dismiss their achievement. They have, in fact, demonstrated that by dunking an egg in and out of hot and cold water like some sort of culinary yo-yo, one can optimize both yolk and white consistency. The periodic egg, they argue, surpasses sous vide in its "creaminess factor," while also maintaining a respectable firmness in the albumen. Itâ€™s the Goldilocks zone of egg cookeryâ€”neither too runny nor too rubbery.

### Implications: Nobel Prize or Michelin Star?

Beyond its culinary implications, the paper boldly suggests that this method might have applications beyond the kitchenâ€”perhaps in material science, crystallization, or even curing processes. Who knew that the humble egg could be the Rosetta Stone of thermodynamics? One can only imagine the conversations that will now transpire in industrial research labs: "Before we finalize this polymerâ€™s thermal cycling treatment, letâ€™s check what the egg paper suggests."

### Final thoughts: the yolk's on us

In all seriousness, while this paper might at first glance seem like a comedic exercise in over-engineering, it does underscore the growing intersection of food science and engineering. It takes a truly curious mind to apply computational modeling to breakfast and an even braver one to defend it in peer review.

Would I try periodic egg cooking at home? Absolutely not. My saucepan and I have an agreement: I provide the heat, it cooks the egg, and we donâ€™t overthink it. But do I admire the effort? Wholeheartedly. Itâ€™s a reminder that no matter how trivial a problem may seem, thereâ€™s always room for scientific curiosityâ€”and a little bit of egg-centric madness.
