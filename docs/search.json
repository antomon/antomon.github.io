Separation or a compromise temperature to the detriment of food safety or taste preference are the options. In the present article, we find that it is possible to cook albumen and yolk at two temperatures without separation by using periodic boundary conditions in the energy transport problem. Through mathematical modeling and subsequent simulation, we are able to design the novel cooking method, namely periodic cooking. Comparison with established egg cooking procedures through a plethora of characterization techniques, including Sensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy, confirms the different cooking extents and the different variations in protein denaturation with the novel approach. The method not only optimizes egg texture and nutrients, but also holds promise for innovative culinary applications and materials treatment.\nLink"

    "text": "Review\nThere are those who push the boundaries of human knowledge‚Äîexploring the cosmos, unraveling the mysteries of quantum mechanics, or curing disease. And then there are those who, armed with computational fluid dynamics software and a dream, dedicate themselves to solving the age-old conundrum of egg cooking.\nLadies and gentlemen, science has finally done it: periodic egg cooking.\nIf you ever found yourself lying awake at night, haunted by the knowledge that egg whites and yolks require different cooking temperatures but didn‚Äôt want to face the barbarity of cracking an egg into a pan, worry no more. Di Lorenzo et al.¬†have blessed us with a solution so elegantly complex that it makes the Hadron Collider look like a child‚Äôs toy.\n\nMethodology: or, how to overcomplicate breakfast\nThe authors introduce the concept of ‚Äúperiodic boundary conditions‚Äù‚Äîwhich, if you assumed was a theory reserved for quantum mechanics, you‚Äôd be mistaken. Apparently, the same principles that guide subatomic particles can be applied to your Sunday brunch. By dunking eggs repeatedly in hot and cold water, one achieves the seemingly impossible: a yolk at 67¬∞C and an albumen at 85¬∞C, without separation. Revolutionary. It‚Äôs unclear if the process also requires a synchronized swimming routine, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.\nThe team employed a dazzling array of techniques‚ÄîSensory Analysis, Texture Profile Analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry. Because, as we all know, breakfast isn‚Äôt truly complete without a spectroscopic deep dive into the molecular nuances of your omelet.\n\n\nFindings: the egg-stential revelation\nThrough meticulous experimentation, the researchers confirm what every Michelin-starred chef and every grandmother with a stovetop has known for centuries: cooking time and temperature affect texture. Astonishing.\nBut let‚Äôs not dismiss their achievement. They have, in fact, demonstrated that by dunking an egg in and out of hot and cold water like some sort of culinary yo-yo, one can optimize both yolk and white consistency. The periodic egg, they argue, surpasses sous vide in its ‚Äúcreaminess factor,‚Äù while also maintaining a respectable firmness in the albumen. It‚Äôs the Goldilocks zone of egg cookery‚Äîneither too runny nor too rubbery.\n\n\nImplications: Nobel Prize or Michelin Star?\nBeyond its culinary implications, the paper boldly suggests that this method might have applications beyond the kitchen‚Äîperhaps in material science, crystallization, or even curing processes. Who knew that the humble egg could be the Rosetta Stone of thermodynamics? One can only imagine the conversations that will now transpire in industrial research labs: ‚ÄúBefore we finalize this polymer‚Äôs thermal cycling treatment, let‚Äôs check what the egg paper suggests.‚Äù\n\n\nFinal thoughts: the yolk‚Äôs on us\nIn all seriousness, while this paper might at first glance seem like a comedic exercise in over-engineering, it does underscore the growing intersection of food science and engineering. It takes a truly curious mind to apply computational modeling to breakfast and an even braver one to defend it in peer review.\nWould I try periodic egg cooking at home? Absolutely not. My saucepan and I have an agreement: I provide the heat, it cooks the egg, and we don‚Äôt overthink it. But do I admire the effort? Wholeheartedly. It‚Äôs a reminder that no matter how trivial a problem may seem, there‚Äôs always room for scientific curiosity‚Äîand a little bit of egg-centric madness."

Schimmenti\nAbstract: ‚ÄúPasta alla cacio e pepe‚Äù is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the ‚ÄúMozzarella Phase‚Äù and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.\nLink"

It‚Äôs a gloriously nerdy deep dive into the thermodynamics of Italian cuisine, with the bonus of a scientifically engineered Cacio e Pepe recipe for when your inner nonna fails you. A must-read for anyone who‚Äôs ever overthought their dinner.\n\nThe harrowing tale of the ‚Äúmozzarella phase,‚Äù where cheese proteins band together to ruin your meal.\n\nWhy starch is the unsung hero of creamy sauces, and how to wield its powers like a culinary sorcerer.\n\nHow to impress friends with pasta and casual mentions of binodal phase separation.\n\nPrepare to be simultaneously amused, educated, and slightly bewildered by this heroic effort to quantify deliciousness.\nCheck it out yourself and let us know if a Roman would approve of the result!"

    "text": "Description\nFrom the site:\n\nStandard Ebooks is a volunteer-driven project that produces new editions of public domain ebooks that are lovingly formatted, open source, free of U.S. copyright restrictions, and free of cost.\nEbook projects like Project Gutenberg transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style manual, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to create a new edition that takes advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology.\nStandard Ebooks aren‚Äôt just a beautiful addition to your digital library‚Äîthey‚Äôre a high quality standard to build your own ebooks on.\n\nModern & consistent typography: Other free ebooks don‚Äôt put much effort into professional-quality typography: they use ‚Äústraight‚Äù quotes instead of ‚Äúcurly‚Äù quotes, they ignore details like em- and en-dashes, and they look more like early-90‚Äôs web pages instead of actual books. Standard Ebooks applies a rigorous and modern style manual when developing each and every ebook to ensure they meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical standard. Our ebooks look good.\nFull proofing with careful corrections: Transcriptions from other sources are often filled with typos or suffer from issues like inconsistent spelling, missing accent marks, or missing punctuation. Submitting corrections to such sources can be difficult or impossible, so errors are rarely fixed. At Standard Ebooks, we do a careful and complete readthrough of each ebook before releasing it, checking it against a scan of the original pages to fix as many typos as possible. Even if we do miss something, our ebooks are stored in the hugely popular Git source control system, allowing anyone to easily submit a correction.\nRich & detailed metadata: Our ebooks include complete, well-researched, and consistent metadata, including original, detailed book blurbs and links to encyclopedia sources. Perfect for machine processing or for extra-curious, technically-minded readers.\nState-of-the-art technology: Each Standard Ebook takes full advantage of the latest ereader technology, including:\n\nHyphenation support,\nPopup footnotes,\nHigh-resolution and scalable vector graphics,\nEreader-compatible tables of contents, and more. One of our goals is to ensure our ebooks stay up-to-date with the best reading experience technology can provide. Just because it‚Äôs a classic doesn‚Äôt mean it has to use old technology.\n\nQuality covers: Everyone knows a book is judged by its cover, but most free ebooks leave it to your ereader software to generate a drab default cover. Standard Ebooks draws from a vast collection of public domain fine art to create attractive, unique, appropriate, and consistent covers for each of our ebooks.\nClean code & semantic markup: Our strict coding standards allow technologists and ebook producers to use Standard Ebooks files as reliable, easy to read, and robust bases for their own work‚Äînot to mention as models of what well-crafted ebook files look like. Common code patterns are repeated through different ebooks, so the code never surprises you. Each ebook is also enhanced with careful standards-based semantic markup that opens the gateway for exciting new kinds of machine processing.\nFree, open-source, & public domain: We use the popular Git source control system to track each and every change made to our ebooks. Anyone can easily see a history of changes, or contribute their own changes with the click of a mouse. And while all of the ebooks we feature and the cover art we draw from are already believed to be in the public domain in the U.S., Standard Ebooks releases all of the work we put in to each ebook into the public domain too. That makes each and every one of our ebook files not just free, but libre too‚Äîbecause the world deserves more unrestricted culture.\n\n\nBrowse"
