A color space is like picking a smaller box from this huge collection. This smaller box contains a specific range of colors that you can use for a particular purpose, like drawing a picture or printing a photograph.\nJust like you can’t use the colors outside your chosen crayon box, a color space defines the range of colors (or ‘gamut’) that can be represented or reproduced in a medium, whether it’s a computer screen, a camera, or a printed page. Different color spaces are like different sets of crayons, each suited for different tasks or equipment.\n\n\nTechnically speaking"
