<h2 data-anchor-id="it-feels-like-a-lifetime-but-its-only-been-a-year">It feels like a lifetime, but it’s only been a year!</h2>
<p>March 2023 marked a turning point in the field of artificial intelligence with the release of <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">OpenAI’s GPT-4</a>. This powerful language model, boasting significant advancements over its predecessors, sent shockwaves through various industries and ignited discussions about the future of human-machine interaction. One year later, it’s clear that GPT-4’s impact has been wide-ranging and continues to evolve.</p>

<p>One of the most notable effects has been the acceleration of AI acceptance. GPT-4’s ability to perform exceptionally on standardized tests, generate human-quality writing, and integrate seamlessly with multimodal data like images and sound, has fostered a sense of legitimacy for large language models. This has emboldened researchers and businesses to explore AI applications with greater confidence.</p>
<p>In the course of evaluating the competencies of GPT-4, OpenAI subjected the model to a series of standardized academic and professional examinations, including the Uniform Bar Exam, the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Quantitative section, and assorted Advanced Placement (AP) subject tests. GPT-4 demonstrated proficiency across numerous assessments, achieving scores comparable to those of human test-takers. This implies that, were GPT-4 to be evaluated purely on its capacity to perform on these tests, it would possess the qualifications to gain admission into law schools and a broad range of universities.</p>

</div>
<p>Prior LLMs often struggled with tasks requiring an understanding of context spread across long stretches of text. With a context windows from 8k to 32k tokens, GPT-4 was able to analyze a much larger chunk of text, allowing it to grasp complex relationships between ideas and follow long-range dependencies.</p>
<p>On September 25th, 2023, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card">announced</a> the rollout of two new features that extend how people can interact with its recent and most advanced model, GPT-4: the ability to ask questions about images and to use speech as an input to a query. Then, on November 6th, 2023, OpenAI announced API access to GPT-4 with Vision. This functionality marked GPT-4’s move into being a multimodal model. This means that the model can accept multiple “modalities” of input – text and images – and return results based on those inputs.</p>
<p>After a year, GPT-4 remains one of the most advanced LLMs, even though the competition is fierce and with formidable opponents. If the rumors are confirmed, in the coming months we will have an even more powerful version that will continue to amaze us, just like the previous ones.</p>

<section id="what-is-about" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="what-is-about">What is about</h4>
<p>The Turing Test, introduced by British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, is a benchmark for evaluating a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In his seminal paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing proposed the question, “Can machines think?” and introduced the concept of the “imitation game” as a criterion for machine intelligence. The test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a machine and a human without seeing them. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test. This test has become a fundamental concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, sparking debates about the nature of intelligence and the potential of machines to emulate human-like consciousness and reasoning.</p>
<p>The Turing Test’s significance lies in its simplicity and profound implications. It provides a straightforward criterion for intelligence that does not rely on the machine’s ability to replicate the human brain’s workings but rather on the outcome of its interactions. Passing the Turing Test is considered a milestone for AI, suggesting that the machine can replicate human-like responses under certain conditions, thereby challenging the distinctions between human and machine intelligence.</p>

<section id="ocean-big-5" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="ocean-big-5">OCEAN Big-5</h4>
<p>Expanding on the OCEAN Big-5, also known as the Big Five personality traits, it’s a model based on common language descriptors of personality. These traits represent broad dimensions of human personality and include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Openness to experience</strong>: Characterized by imagination, creativity, and a willingness to try new things. High openness indicates a person who enjoys novelty, variety, and intellectual pursuits. Lower openness may suggest a more conventional and practical orientation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conscientiousness</strong>: Involves self-discipline, orderliness, and a drive for achievement. Highly conscientious individuals are organized and responsible, often with a strong work ethic. Lower scores may indicate a more relaxed or spontaneous approach to life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraversion</strong>: Denotes sociability, excitement-seeking, and positive emotions. Extroverts are typically energetic and enjoy being around other people, while introverts (lower extraversion) may prefer solitude and more subdued environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agreeableness</strong>: Reflects a person’s altruistic, cooperative, and compassionate nature. High agreeableness is associated with trust and helpfulness, whereas lower agreeableness may manifest as skepticism or competitive behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neuroticism</strong>: Pertains to emotional stability and the tendency to experience negative emotions. Higher neuroticism scores indicate a greater likelihood of feeling anxious, depressed, or angry, while lower scores suggest a calmer and more resilient disposition.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These traits provide a framework for understanding human personality and predicting a wide range of behaviors, from academic and occupational success to relationships and well-being. In the context of AI, applying the OCEAN Big-5 to evaluate chatbots like ChatGPT allows researchers to assess how closely these systems mimic human personality traits, contributing to the ongoing exploration of machine “personality” and its implications for human-AI interaction.</p>

<section id="the-research-from-jackson-et-al." class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="the-research-from-jackson-et-al.">The Research from Jackson et al.</h4>
<p>A research consortium led by Matthew Jackson, who holds the William D. Eberle Professorship of Economics within Stanford University’s School of Humanities and Sciences, conducted an empirical analysis of the behavioral and personality attributes of the AI-driven entities within ChatGPT, employing methodologies derived from psychology and behavioral economics. Their findings, documented in the paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313925121">A Turing test of whether AI chatbots are behaviorally similar to humans</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated that ChatGPT 4, exhibited indistinguishability from human participants in behavioral assessments. Notably, when the AI opted for atypical human behavioral patterns, it manifested increased levels of cooperativeness and altruism.</p>
<p>This investigative endeavor subjected versions 3 and 4 of ChatGPT to a prevalent personality assessment alongside a series of behavioral experiments designed to forecast socio-economic and ethical decision-making tendencies. These experiments encompassed standardized scenarios that required participants to make choices on dilemmas such as betraying a complicit criminal or allocating monetary resources under various incentive structures. The AI responses were benchmarked against a dataset comprising over 100,000 human participants spanning 50 nations.</p>
<p>Within the OCEAN Big-5, ChatGPT version 4 aligned with the normal human range for these traits but ranked in the lower third percentile in terms of agreeableness compared to the human sample. Despite passing the Turing Test, this level of agreeableness suggests limited social appeal.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>“Big Five” personality profiles of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 compared with the distributions of human subjects. The blue, orange, and green lines correspond to the median scores of humans, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-3 respectively; the shaded areas represent the middle 95% of the scores, across each of the dimensions. ChatGPT’s personality profiles are within the range of the human distribution, even though ChatGPT-3 scored noticeably lower in Openness.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Comparative analysis between versions 3 and 4 revealed significant advancements in the latter’s performance, with version 3 displaying agreeableness and openness to experience at the lower end of the human spectrum, indicative of a lesser capacity for novel ideas and experiences.</p>
<p>The methodology for assessing AI behavior in the experimental games involved calculating the frequency of specific actions (e.g., equitable distribution of funds) among both human participants and the AI. Subsequently, the researchers compared a randomly selected human action to one from the AI sessions to ascertain the likelihood of human origin. In the majority of these exercises, actions taken by version 4 were more consistently aligned with human behavior than those of version 3, which did not meet the Turing Test criteria.</p>

<h3 data-anchor-id="impact-on-work">Impact on Work</h3>
<p>The study <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-013_d9b45b68-9e74-42d6-a1c6-c72fb70c7282.pdf">Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality</a> by Dell’Acqua et al.&nbsp;explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, on the productivity and quality of work among knowledge workers at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). This comprehensive experiment involved 758 consultants and aimed to understand how AI affects complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="Distribution-output-quality.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Distribution of output quality across all the tasks" width="900"></p>
<figcaption>Distribution of output quality across all the tasks. The blue group did not use AI, the green and red groups used AI, the red group got some additional training on how to use AI</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The study introduces the concept of a “jagged technological frontier,” suggesting that AI capabilities are uneven across different tasks. Some tasks are significantly enhanced by AI, leading to improved productivity and quality, while others, seemingly similar in difficulty, lie outside AI’s current capabilities and can lead to decreased performance when AI is utilized.</p>
<p>Participants were divided into three groups: a control group with no AI access, a group with access to GPT-4, and a group with GPT-4 access plus a prompt engineering overview. The findings revealed that for tasks within AI’s capabilities, the use of AI led to a notable increase in both the quantity and quality of work. Consultants were able to complete more tasks and with better outcomes, demonstrating that AI can be a powerful tool for augmenting human capabilities in knowledge work.</p>
<p>However, for tasks selected to be outside the AI’s frontier, reliance on AI resulted in a decrease in performance. This highlights the importance of understanding AI’s limitations and suggests that indiscriminate use of AI can have negative consequences.</p>
<p>The study also observed two distinct patterns of AI integration among successful users: “Centaurs,” who strategically divided tasks between themselves and AI, and “Cyborgs,” who integrated AI more fully into their workflow. These findings suggest varying approaches to integrating AI into professional tasks, emphasizing the need for users to adapt their strategies based on the task at hand and AI’s capabilities.</p>
<p>In summary, the study provides empirical evidence on the dual role of AI in enhancing and sometimes detracting from professional knowledge work. It highlights the need for careful consideration of when and how to deploy AI tools, as well as the potential for AI to significantly impact work processes and outcomes within its capabilities. The concept of the jagged technological frontier offers a framework for understanding the complex and evolving relationship between AI and human work, underscoring the importance of navigating this frontier effectively to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks.</p>

This enables chatbots to interact with customer relationship management (CRM) systems to update deal statuses or to employ Python interpreters for performing data science tasks. Additionally, it allows for the transformation of user inquiries into search commands for vector databases or search engines, empowering work assistants to autonomously navigate through various databases and platforms to gather pertinent information or execute comparative evaluations.</p>
<p>Tool usage with Command-R involves a four-stage process: initially, developers configure which tools the model can access and the format of interactions (e.g., API calls, JSON-formatted instructions). Command-R then judiciously selects the suitable tools and parameters for these interactions. Subsequently, developers execute these tool interactions, obtaining results, which are then fed back into Command-R to generate the final response.</p>
