<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re building a healthcare app that needs to analyze patient data stored in the cloud. Since the data is sensitive, you encrypt it before sending it. However, every time you need to analyze the data, you have to decrypt it, which means the data is exposed and creates a security risk.</p>
<p>This is the main problem with traditional encryption systems like RSA and AES. They protect data while it’s stored or sent, but as soon as you need to use the data, you have to decrypt it. It’s like keeping money in a safe but needing to take it out every time you want to count it. This fundamental limitation makes it challenging to keep sensitive information secure throughout its lifecycle, especially as more applications rely on cloud computing, where the need for remote processing is common.</p>
<p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) aims to solve this problem by allowing data to remain encrypted even while it’s being processed. It promises to make the cloud much safer for storing and analyzing data, which could have far-reaching impacts on healthcare, finance, and many other fields. Imagine being able to calculate the average income of a group of people without ever knowing how much any individual earns—that’s the promise of HE.</p>
<section id="the-challenge-with-data-security" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge-with-data-security">The challenge with data security</h3>
<p>Even when data is encrypted and stored in the cloud, there are still some risks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Metadata exposure: Even if the data is encrypted, cloud providers can still see some information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the data is accessed.</li>
<li>How much data is being processed.</li>
<li>Patterns of usage that could reveal some details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Metadata may not contain the actual content of the data, but it can still provide insights that compromise privacy. For instance, frequent access to a medical record could imply a serious health condition, even if the actual diagnosis remains encrypted.</p></li>
<li><p>Trust issues: Cloud providers or intermediaries who have access to encryption keys could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access decrypted data when it’s being processed.</li>
<li>Keep metadata even after the service ends.</li>
<li>Create privacy risks by storing information about data access, which could help them infer details even if the data itself is never fully decrypted</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues highlight the importance of removing the need to trust third parties. HE can help solve this problem by ensuring that data remains encrypted, even when it’s being analyzed.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="computing-on-encrypted-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computing-on-encrypted-data">Computing on encrypted data</h3>
<p>HE is like a magic trick that lets you do math on data without ever actually seeing the data. Imagine helping someone count their money without them ever opening their wallet.</p>
<p>Let’s say a client has some data (x), and a server has a function (f). The client wants to know the answer to f(x):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traditional approach: The client has to share x with the server.</p></li>
<li><p>HE approach: The client sends an encrypted version of x to the server, and the server does the calculations on the encrypted data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How can you do calculations on encrypted data? This works because of something called <strong>semantic security</strong>. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The encryption is random.</p></li>
<li><p>Encrypting the same input twice will give different results each time.</p></li>
<li><p>The result of a calculation on encrypted data is also encrypted and looks completely different from the input.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s like putting your data in a different locked box every time—each box looks different, and no one can tell what’s inside just by looking at it.</p>
<p>This “magic trick” makes HE extremely powerful for situations where privacy is crucial. It allows sensitive information to be processed by remote servers without the risk of exposing the actual data. Imagine if healthcare providers could analyze patient data to find patterns for research, all while keeping every individual’s data private. HE could enable exactly that.</p>

<section id="how-does-he-work" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-does-he-work">How Does HE Work?</h3>
<p>In traditional encryption, encrypted data can’t be processed in any useful way. It’s like trying to add two numbers written in totally different languages.</p>
<p>HE is different because it keeps the relationships between numbers, even when they’re encrypted. Here’s a simple example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let’s say you have two numbers, <span class="math inline">a</span> and <span class="math inline">b</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>You encrypt them to get <span class="math inline">E(a)</span> and <span class="math inline">E(b)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>With HE, you can add <span class="math inline">E(a)</span> and <span class="math inline">E(b)</span> and get an encrypted result that, when decrypted, gives you <span class="math inline">a + b</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This means you can perform calculations on encrypted data without having to decrypt it first. The ability to compute on encrypted data without decryption is what makes HE so revolutionary. In essence, it allows data to stay secure throughout its entire lifecycle, from collection to storage to processing.</p>
<p>HE works by using complex mathematical operations that preserve the structure of the data even when it’s encrypted. The mathematics behind this is quite advanced, involving polynomial functions and number theory. These mathematical techniques ensure that operations such as addition and multiplication can be performed on the encrypted data in a way that yields correct results when decrypted.</p>
</section>
<section id="types-of-he" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-he">Types of HE</h3>
<p>There are a few different types of HE, each with its strengths and limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Partially HE (PHE)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports only one type of operation, like multiplication.</li>
<li>Faster but limited in what it can do.</li>
<li>Useful for applications that require only a single type of computation, such as multiplying encrypted values to calculate totals in a secure manner.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Somewhat HE (SWHE)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports both addition and multiplication but only up to a certain limit.</li>
<li>It’s like a calculator with limited battery—it works for a while but eventually stops.</li>
<li>SWHE can be useful when you need to perform a few operations, but it doesn’t support unlimited computation. For example, it could be used in a scenario where only a fixed number of additions and multiplications are needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fully HE (FHE)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports unlimited operations on encrypted data.</li>
<li>This is the “holy grail” of encryption and was first discovered by Craig Gentry in 2009.</li>
<li>It can be slow and require a lot of computing power, but it offers the most flexibility.</li>
<li>FHE is the ultimate solution for privacy-preserving data processing, allowing for complex computations, such as machine learning algorithms, to be performed securely on encrypted data.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="how-he-enhances-private-computing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-he-enhances-private-computing">How HE enhances private computing</h3>
<p>HE can be combined with other privacy techniques to keep data secure while still being able to use it. These techniques are independent but can work well together with HE to achieve privacy goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Differential Privacy (DP)</strong>: DP is a method that ensures individual data points in a dataset can’t be identified, even if the results are analyzed multiple times. By adding noise to the output, DP protects people’s privacy while still allowing useful insights to be gained from the data. HE can be combined with DP to keep data encrypted during analysis, while DP adds another layer of privacy. For example, a healthcare company could use HE to compute encrypted patient data and add differential privacy to ensure that the output does not compromise individual identities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)</strong>: SMC allows several parties to jointly compute a result from their inputs without revealing those inputs to each other. HE is often used in SMC to make sure the data stays encrypted throughout the computation. This way, everyone can contribute without giving up their private data. For example, multiple banks could jointly analyze data to detect fraud patterns without sharing individual customer information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</strong>: ZKPs are a way to prove that a statement is true without revealing any other information beyond the fact that the statement is true. ZKPs can be combined with HE to verify computations on encrypted data without revealing any sensitive information. This is particularly useful in scenarios like blockchain, where privacy and verification are both important. For instance, ZKPs could allow someone to prove they have enough funds for a transaction without revealing their exact account balance.</p></li>

<section id="private-information-retrieval" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="private-information-retrieval">Private information retrieval</h4>
<p>Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic technique that allows a client to retrieve data from a large database held by a server without revealing which specific piece of data is being requested. More formally, PIR is designed to ensure that the query sent by the client does not leak any information to the server about the data being retrieved. This property is achieved through advanced cryptographic protocols, such as computational PIR or information-theoretic PIR, that prevent the server from learning anything about the client’s request while still being able to provide the correct response.</p>
<p>Common algorithms used in PIR include the Chor-Goldreich-Kushilevitz (CGK) scheme for information-theoretic PIR and lattice-based approaches for computational PIR. Tools like Microsoft’s SEAL library, Google’s Private Join and Compute framework, and commercial solutions such as NTT Data’s PIR implementation, Duality Technologies’ SecureQuery platform, and Oracle’s data privacy tools are also used to implement PIR efficiently. These algorithms and tools ensure that privacy is maintained without sacrificing performance, making PIR practical for real-world applications where privacy and efficiency are both critical.</p>
<p>Imagine the server is holding a massive collection, like the US patent database, and the client wants to retrieve one particular record without revealing which one it is. Using HE, the client encrypts the index of the record they want to retrieve. The server then performs a computation on the encrypted index to generate an encrypted result, which is sent back to the client. This computation is performed in such a way that the server never learns the content of the index or the nature of the data requested. Finally, the client decrypts the result to obtain the plaintext record they were looking for.</p>
<p>PIR is especially useful in situations where privacy is crucial, such as when accessing large public databases or confidential corporate data. It allows users to perform queries without revealing their interests or compromising their privacy. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential, even when interacting with third-party databases, thereby enhancing both security and user trust.</p>
<p>Real-world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Patent database retrieval: A client can request a specific record from a large patent database without revealing which one they need. The client sends an encrypted index of the record, and the server processes this to return the encrypted result. For example, researchers can use PIR to access specific patents in the US patent database for a project without revealing which patents they are interested in. This ensures that sensitive intellectual property research remains confidential.</p></li>
<li><p>Medical information retrieval: PIR allows a patient to retrieve a specific medical record from a hospital database without the hospital knowing which record was requested. For example, a patient undergoing treatment for a sensitive condition can use PIR to retrieve specific medical records without revealing their interest to the hospital staff, thereby ensuring full confidentiality. This approach is especially beneficial for patients dealing with stigmatized conditions, allowing them to maintain privacy while managing their health.</p></li>
<li><p>Corporate data retrieval: Employees of a company can retrieve records from a confidential database without revealing which record they are looking for. For instance, an employee working on a confidential project could use PIR to access specific internal documents without revealing the nature of their query to the IT team, ensuring that confidential research remains secure. This is particularly important for organizations in competitive industries, where safeguarding project details and proprietary research is essential.</p></li>
<li><p>Academic research collaboration: PIR enables multiple research institutions to collaboratively access sensitive datasets while maintaining the confidentiality of each request. For example, researchers studying sensitive health data across different universities can use PIR to collaborate on a large-scale study while maintaining privacy regarding their specific research interests.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer support information retrieval: Customer service representatives can use PIR to access specific customer records without revealing which record is being accessed to unauthorized personnel. For instance, a representative could retrieve a customer’s previous support history without the support platform’s backend knowing which customer record was accessed. This helps maintain the privacy of sensitive customer information.</p></li>
<li><p>E-commerce product information: PIR allows buyers to access specific product details from a large e-commerce catalog without revealing which product they are interested in. For instance, a user researching a high-value item can retrieve product information without revealing their interest, thereby preventing targeted marketing or price manipulation by the platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Government records access: PIR enables citizens to access certain public records without the government knowing which specific record is being accessed. For example, a journalist researching a sensitive topic can use PIR to access specific government documents without revealing their focus, ensuring freedom of information while maintaining confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual property research: Legal teams or corporations can search through a database of patents or trademarks without revealing the specific intellectual property they are researching. For instance, during early stages of product development, a company can use PIR to verify patent details without competitors learning about their research interests, thus maintaining strategic confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p>Human resources record access: HR personnel can access specific employee records without revealing which record they are interested in to other departments or unauthorized personnel. For example, during an internal audit, an HR manager might need to review sensitive records without exposing which employees are being audited, ensuring privacy and avoiding unnecessary speculation.</p></li>
<li><p>Legal document retrieval: Law firms often need to access specific legal documents from a shared database without disclosing which document they are searching for, especially during cases involving multiple parties. For instance, during a merger or acquisition, legal teams can use PIR to access critical contract details without tipping off competing firms about their focus, keeping negotiations confidential.</p></li>
<li><p>Supply chain data access: PIR allows manufacturers to access specific supply chain information from a shared logistics database without revealing their focus to other stakeholders. For example, a car manufacturer may verify part availability without revealing to suppliers which model they are currently prioritizing, thereby maintaining competitive confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p>Market analysis for financial institutions: Financial analysts may need to retrieve specific market data from a large dataset without revealing which data points they are interested in. By using PIR, analysts can query the database and obtain encrypted results without disclosing their market focus. For example, an investment firm researching emerging markets can access key economic indicators without revealing their specific interests, thereby maintaining a competitive edge.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beyond-he">Beyond HE</h3>
<p>HE is a powerful tool in cryptography that has the potential to revolutionize data privacy. It allows computations to be carried out on encrypted data without requiring access to the original plaintext. This capability has significant implications for secure data processing, enabling cloud-based services to perform calculations on sensitive information while preserving privacy. However, despite its transformative possibilities, HE comes with several limitations and challenges that must be addressed before it can be widely adopted in practical applications.</p>
<p>Below, we outline some of the challenges and constraints associated with HE, providing a deeper understanding of its current limitations and the efforts needed to overcome them.</p>
<section id="challenges" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Encrypted output: While HE allows for arbitrary computations on encrypted data, the outcome of these computations is still encrypted. This means that the result is only useful to someone with the secret key to decrypt it. For example, if a cloud server performs a complex computation on encrypted health records, the resulting encrypted output cannot be interpreted without the corresponding decryption key. This presents a challenge for practical implementations, as it requires data owners to perform decryption locally to understand the results. In contrast, other techniques like obfuscation and functional encryption enable certain types of encrypted computations where the output is directly accessible in plaintext. These techniques can be more practical in situations where immediate interpretation of results is required. Another drawback of the encrypted output is the lack of flexibility for collaboration. In many use cases, organizations need to share the results of computations with multiple stakeholders who may not have access to the decryption key. This means that HE, by default, limits the ease of sharing processed information unless additional mechanisms for key distribution are implemented. As a result, using HE often necessitates careful planning around how decryption keys are managed and shared, which can introduce additional security concerns. Managing key distribution securely while ensuring accessibility is an ongoing area of research in the field of cryptography.</li>
</ol>
<p>2- Single key requirement: To perform computations on encrypted data, all inputs must be encrypted using the same key. This constraint limits scenarios where data from multiple sources, encrypted with different keys, needs to be jointly processed. For instance, in a scenario where multiple healthcare providers wish to collaborate on a dataset of encrypted patient records, each provider’s data must be encrypted with the same key for joint analysis to be possible. This presents a significant barrier to collaboration, as coordinating the use of a single encryption key across multiple entities introduces security and logistical challenges. Addressing this limitation often requires the use of advanced key management techniques or trusted intermediaries, which can complicate the overall system architecture. Techniques like secure multiparty computation (SMC) can sometimes be used alongside HE to facilitate joint computations without sharing a common key, but these solutions tend to increase computational overhead and complexity. Moreover, the need for a single key also raises concerns about key compromise—if the key is exposed, all encrypted data becomes vulnerable, making key security a critical aspect of using HE in real-world applications. Researchers are actively exploring methods to allow computations on data encrypted with different keys, such as through key homomorphism or the use of proxy re-encryption. These approaches aim to enable interoperability between datasets encrypted with different keys, thereby enhancing the practicality of HE for collaborative applications. However, these methods are still in their experimental stages and are not yet widely adopted in mainstream cryptographic systems.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>No integrity guarantees: HE allows for computations on encrypted data, but it does not provide a mechanism to verify that the computations were performed correctly. In other words, there is no inherent way to confirm if the resulting ciphertext is genuinely the outcome of the intended computation or if it is simply a new encryption of an unrelated value. This lack of integrity verification is a significant limitation, particularly in scenarios where the correctness of the computation is critical, such as financial transactions or medical data analysis. Without integrity guarantees, there is a risk that a malicious server could manipulate the computation process, resulting in incorrect outputs without detection. For instance, if a cloud provider intentionally or unintentionally alters the computation on encrypted financial records, the resulting encrypted output could be incorrect, leading to potential financial losses for the data owner. To address this issue, additional cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used in combination with HE to provide assurance that computations were performed correctly. Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that a computation was executed as expected without revealing any information about the input data. By integrating ZKPs with HE, it is possible to create a system where the server can provide verifiable proof that it performed the computation correctly. However, adding ZKPs to the process increases computational complexity and may impact performance, making it important to balance the need for integrity with the computational resources available. Another approach to ensuring the integrity of computations is the use of blockchain technology. By recording the steps of the computation on a blockchain, it is possible to create a transparent and tamper-resistant log that can be audited by all parties involved. This method, while promising, also introduces additional overhead and requires careful consideration of scalability, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-directions">Future directions</h4>
<p>In addition to the limitations outlined above, HE faces several other challenges that need to be addressed to make it more practical for widespread use. These challenges include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Performance overheads: HE is computationally intensive compared to traditional encryption methods. Performing even basic operations on encrypted data can require significantly more processing power and time. FHE, which supports arbitrary computations, is particularly demanding and often impractical for real-time applications due to its high computational costs. Researchers are working on optimizing FHE schemes to reduce these performance overheads, but significant progress is still needed before they can be used in everyday applications. Advances such as bootstrapping optimizations and hardware acceleration are being explored to mitigate these challenges.</p></li>
<li><p>Large ciphertext sizes: Encrypted data under HE schemes tends to be much larger than the original plaintext data. This increase in data size, known as ciphertext expansion, can lead to storage and bandwidth issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets. For example, encrypting a simple medical record using FHE can result in a ciphertext that is several orders of magnitude larger than the original record. This makes storage and transmission of encrypted data more challenging, especially in environments with limited resources. Researchers are investigating techniques like compression schemes and more efficient ciphertext representations to reduce the overhead associated with HE.</p></li>
<li><p>Complexity of implementation: Implementing HE is complex and requires a deep understanding of advanced mathematics and cryptographic principles. This complexity makes it difficult for developers to integrate HE into their applications without specialized knowledge. To address this barrier, researchers and developers are working on creating libraries and tools that simplify the use of HE, making it more accessible to non-experts. However, there is still a long way to go before these tools are as user-friendly as traditional encryption libraries. Efforts like Microsoft SEAL, PALISADE, and other open-source libraries are helping bridge this gap, but more work is needed to make HE adoption mainstream.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of standardization: Another challenge with HE is the lack of standardization across different implementations. Currently, there are multiple HE schemes, each with its unique properties, trade-offs, and performance characteristics. This fragmentation makes it difficult for developers and organizations to choose the right scheme for their needs and complicates interoperability between systems using different HE protocols. Ongoing efforts by organizations such as the HomomorphicEncryption.org community aim to create standardized benchmarks and guidelines to help users navigate the complexities of HE and choose the most suitable options for their use cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Key management and distribution: The effective management of encryption keys is a critical factor in ensuring the security of HE systems. As discussed earlier, HE often requires a single key to encrypt all data inputs, making key distribution a complex challenge, particularly in collaborative environments. If the key is compromised, all encrypted data becomes vulnerable. Key rotation mechanisms, secure key storage solutions, and the development of multi-key HE are all areas of active research to address these key management challenges. Proxy re-encryption and distributed key generation are also being explored as potential solutions to facilitate secure key sharing across different entities without compromising security.</p></li>
<li><p>Scalability issues: HE can be difficult to scale, especially for applications requiring large-scale data processing, such as big data analytics or machine learning. The computational overhead and increased data sizes make scaling HE to handle vast amounts of information a considerable challenge. Researchers are exploring the use of hybrid cryptographic solutions, where HE is combined with other privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and secure multiparty computation, to achieve a balance between scalability and privacy. These hybrid approaches can potentially make HE more viable for large-scale, real-time applications by distributing the computational burden and reducing latency.</p></li>
