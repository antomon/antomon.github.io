<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>We are living through one of the most exhilarating moments in the history of technology. Every day, breakthroughs in machine learning, data pipelines, automation, and edge computing redefine the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
<p>For me, being an <strong>interim manager</strong> in this landscape is not just a job, it’s a creative calling, a unique opportunity to shape the future of how businesses operate, grow, and thrive.</p>
<p>I don’t just help companies “go digital.” I help them reimagine what they <em>can become</em>. My work is about turning vision into architecture, uncertainty into opportunity, and potential into working systems. I bring together <strong>strategy and execution, architecture and operations, culture and code</strong>.</p>
<p>And in this era, where AI reshapes every domain it touches, I see my role as both <strong>builder and guide</strong>—someone who can sketch the future at the enterprise level and then lead the team that gets us there, step by step, sprint by sprint.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-architecture-to-transformation">From architecture to transformation</h2>
<p>Enterprise architecture is often misunderstood as a governance-heavy discipline, focused on documentation and frameworks. For me, architecture is a <strong>compass for transformation</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s the lens that connects <strong>vision to execution</strong>, ensuring that every decision—from data models to ERP rollout, from cloud adoption to cybersecurity posture—aligns with strategic intent.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve blended <strong>TOGAF, ArchiMate, design thinking, Agile, and DevOps</strong> into what I call <em>adaptive architecture</em>: a practical way to drive clarity and momentum without drowning in methodology.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Architecture, for me, is not just about artifacts. It’s about <strong>narratives that create alignment</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s not just about current and target states. It’s about <strong>roadmaps that organizations can walk, even in uncertainty</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s not just governance. It’s <strong>transformation scaffolding</strong>, holding complexity in place until change becomes natural.</p></li>

  <title>Simulating Tethered Buoy Dynamics</title>
  <dc:creator>Antonio Montano</dc:creator>
  <link>https://antomon.github.io/posts/tethered-buoy-dynamics/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A few days ago, I received a fresh citation notification referencing an article titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10256">“On the use of an advanced Kirchhoff rod model to study mooring lines”</a>. That small note sparked a surge of memories from the intense period when I was searching for a stable, accurate way to model a tethered buoy system. It seemed like the perfect moment to revisit a project that, for me, was marked by long stretches of frustration and the pure joy of each breakthrough.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable how twenty years can deepen one’s perspective on a project as intricate and rewarding as simulating a tethered buoy system. I initially aimed to model a buoy afloat on the ocean surface, secured by a cable so stiff that it scarcely stretched under large tension. Over the years, I’ve watched that early spark of curiosity evolve into a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and practical details essential to making it all work. Despite countless hours testing equations, running simulations, and honing algorithms, this endeavor remains among the most gratifying I’ve undertaken.</p>

<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Mixed finite elements emerged as the linchpin for dealing with a cable of extremely high Young’s modulus. In a more standard approach, tension might be computed strictly as a derivative of displacement, a method prone to severe numerical instability, especially when the model was pushed close to its inextensible limit. By employing a strategy akin to incompressible fluid simulations, in which pressure is treated separately from velocity, we disentangled tension from displacement. This demanded meticulous algebraic checks, careful boundary condition enforcement, and diverse validation tests. Yet the outcome was a stable formulation capable of handling real-world cable stiffness. It often reminded me of fluid mechanics, where treating pressure as an independent variable helps circumvent the pitfalls of near-incompressibility.</p>
<p>Quaternion-based buoy motion posed a similarly unconventional challenge. Large, abrupt rotations from rough seas or vigorous currents made Euler angles precarious—one intense swing could trigger numerical lockups or cause the entire orientation model to fail. By turning to quaternions, although less common in many engineering circles at the time, we found a smooth, singularity-free representation of every possible orientation in three-dimensional space. We tested the approach with simulations of tempest-level storms and sharp angle changes to confirm that the buoy’s motion stayed plausible. Repeatedly, quaternions rose to the occasion, allowing the buoy’s full rotational dynamics to unfold without numerical breakdown.</p>
<p>Implicit time-stepping formed the final cornerstone of our method. A cable on the brink of inextensibility transmits wave forces at high speeds, rendering an explicit solver prohibitively slow due to the tiny time steps required for stability. We chose a backward Euler scheme, tackling a large-scale, nonlinear system at each time increment. To manage the complexity, we turned to a damped Newton method, iterating on a solution guess while tuning the damping for smooth convergence. Though heavier computationally, this allowed for significantly larger time steps and a practical balance between accuracy and runtime. In numerous experiments, once the Newton iterations converged, the results were physically coherent and free of the instabilities we had feared.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-results">The results</h2>
<p>Armed with these three pillars, we investigated diverse scenarios, from cables so stiff they bordered on rigid to longer, more flexible lines. We included realistic wave heights, wind speeds, and currents typical of commercial mooring installations. Observing the buoy’s subtle rocking, dramatic heaving, and swirling rotations underscored how the system responded to external forces. Each validation run comparing our data with known behavior reinforced confidence that we had captured the essential physics.</p>
<p>Even when we dialed stiffness to extremes, the simulation avoided catastrophic instability. Our mixed formulation for cable tension and displacement, coupled with an implicit time stepper, maintained a consistent evolution from step to step. Simultaneously, quaternions let us depict conditions ranging from tranquil seas, with mild buoy bobbing, to rough waters involving severe pitching and rolling. Feedback from industry contacts affirmed that these capabilities opened valuable avenues for mooring design, especially under extreme weather or when safeguarding delicate equipment on the buoy deck. By matching simulations to real-world observations—like how far a buoy might drift under heavy seas—we significantly bolstered trust in our overall approach.</p>
<p>In the end, the model bridged a gap between purely theoretical inquiry and the concrete engineering tasks that oceanographers, marine engineers, and equipment designers face. Running multi-day or even multi-week simulations without exorbitant computational overhead was an exciting prospect. This was no longer a mere academic puzzle; it was a practical tool likely to inform how mooring lines are specified, built, and managed, whether for scientific stations or navigation beacons in high-traffic waters.</p>

<p>This project also unified my engineering approach to physics and mathematics in a problem that originated from a company that, to this day, continues to produce buoys. The challenge wasn’t just academic; it was a real-world issue that required scientific rigor to solve. The culmination of our work was published in <strong>Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering</strong> under the title <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2007.04.012">Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Tethered Buoy Dynamics</a></strong>, co-authored with Marco Restelli and Riccardo Sacco. The publication validated our approach and demonstrated that tackling practical engineering problems with strong theoretical foundations could yield robust and widely applicable solutions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>
<p>Reflecting on this project, I’m amazed at the breadth of expertise required. We merged advanced finite element theories, wave force modeling, buoy geometry, and fluid–structure interaction, all in a single system. Yes, we faced frustrating snags—bug hunts that stretched late into the night or solver conflicts that cropped up unexpectedly—but each resolution felt like a tangible stride toward a robust, trustworthy model.</p>
<p>The satisfaction stands out most vividly. Every instance of pushing the model—testing bigger waves, trickier cables, or new geometric nuances—brought the thrill of seeing it hold firm. The mathematics we’d nurtured for so long manifested as on-screen visualizations of swirling seawater, with a buoy steadily riding the crests and troughs. It was then that I realized we had transcended theoretical musings, delivering a resource for engineers, researchers, and maritime professionals alike.</p>
<p>Two decades on, I still regard it as a testament to collaboration, persistence, and solid mathematical foundations. Tackling problems of this scope often demands stepping beyond familiar territory, whether by redefining tension as a separate unknown or adopting quaternions for orientation. My hope is that others may glean encouragement from our experiences, confident that even though the road is strewn with roadblocks and late-night coding trials, a thoroughly validated, widely beneficial system makes it all worthwhile.</p>
<p>I should also underline how indispensable the MOX environment at Politecnico di Milano was. The department teemed with resourceful researchers who offered both theoretical knowledge and practical engineering insight. They possessed a rare knack for fusing advanced mathematical techniques with real-world requirements, their open-minded spirit inspiring each brainstorming session. Working there meant a stream of fresh ideas, incisive critiques, and the kind of camaraderie that keeps tough projects alive.</p>
<p>To this day, nothing pleases me more than receiving word of a fresh citation or reference to our work. Each new mention affirms that the methods we pieced together continue to serve those who grapple with similarly challenging scenarios. That ongoing relevance speaks volumes about the enduring value of thorough research, well beyond the date of publication.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="it-feels-like-a-lifetime-but-its-only-been-a-year" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="it-feels-like-a-lifetime-but-its-only-been-a-year">It feels like a lifetime, but it’s only been a year!</h2>
<p>March 2023 marked a turning point in the field of artificial intelligence with the release of <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">OpenAI’s GPT-4</a>. This powerful language model, boasting significant advancements over its predecessors, sent shockwaves through various industries and ignited discussions about the future of human-machine interaction. One year later, it’s clear that GPT-4’s impact has been wide-ranging and continues to evolve.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the most notable effects has been the acceleration of AI acceptance. GPT-4’s ability to perform exceptionally on standardized tests, generate human-quality writing, and integrate seamlessly with multimodal data like images and sound, has fostered a sense of legitimacy for large language models. This has emboldened researchers and businesses to explore AI applications with greater confidence.</p>
<p>In the course of evaluating the competencies of GPT-4, OpenAI subjected the model to a series of standardized academic and professional examinations, including the Uniform Bar Exam, the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Quantitative section, and assorted Advanced Placement (AP) subject tests. GPT-4 demonstrated proficiency across numerous assessments, achieving scores comparable to those of human test-takers. This implies that, were GPT-4 to be evaluated purely on its capacity to perform on these tests, it would possess the qualifications to gain admission into law schools and a broad range of universities.</p>

<p>Prior LLMs often struggled with tasks requiring an understanding of context spread across long stretches of text. With a context windows from 8k to 32k tokens, GPT-4 was able to analyze a much larger chunk of text, allowing it to grasp complex relationships between ideas and follow long-range dependencies.</p>
<p>On September 25th, 2023, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card">announced</a> the rollout of two new features that extend how people can interact with its recent and most advanced model, GPT-4: the ability to ask questions about images and to use speech as an input to a query. Then, on November 6th, 2023, OpenAI announced API access to GPT-4 with Vision. This functionality marked GPT-4’s move into being a multimodal model. This means that the model can accept multiple “modalities” of input – text and images – and return results based on those inputs.</p>
<p>After a year, GPT-4 remains one of the most advanced LLMs, even though the competition is fierce and with formidable opponents. If the rumors are confirmed, in the coming months we will have an even more powerful version that will continue to amaze us, just like the previous ones.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-about">What is about</h4>
<p>The Turing Test, introduced by British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, is a benchmark for evaluating a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In his seminal paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing proposed the question, “Can machines think?” and introduced the concept of the “imitation game” as a criterion for machine intelligence. The test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a machine and a human without seeing them. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test. This test has become a fundamental concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, sparking debates about the nature of intelligence and the potential of machines to emulate human-like consciousness and reasoning.</p>
<p>The Turing Test’s significance lies in its simplicity and profound implications. It provides a straightforward criterion for intelligence that does not rely on the machine’s ability to replicate the human brain’s workings but rather on the outcome of its interactions. Passing the Turing Test is considered a milestone for AI, suggesting that the machine can replicate human-like responses under certain conditions, thereby challenging the distinctions between human and machine intelligence.</p>

<li><p><strong>Conscientiousness</strong>: Involves self-discipline, orderliness, and a drive for achievement. Highly conscientious individuals are organized and responsible, often with a strong work ethic. Lower scores may indicate a more relaxed or spontaneous approach to life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraversion</strong>: Denotes sociability, excitement-seeking, and positive emotions. Extroverts are typically energetic and enjoy being around other people, while introverts (lower extraversion) may prefer solitude and more subdued environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agreeableness</strong>: Reflects a person’s altruistic, cooperative, and compassionate nature. High agreeableness is associated with trust and helpfulness, whereas lower agreeableness may manifest as skepticism or competitive behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neuroticism</strong>: Pertains to emotional stability and the tendency to experience negative emotions. Higher neuroticism scores indicate a greater likelihood of feeling anxious, depressed, or angry, while lower scores suggest a calmer and more resilient disposition.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These traits provide a framework for understanding human personality and predicting a wide range of behaviors, from academic and occupational success to relationships and well-being. In the context of AI, applying the OCEAN Big-5 to evaluate chatbots like ChatGPT allows researchers to assess how closely these systems mimic human personality traits, contributing to the ongoing exploration of machine “personality” and its implications for human-AI interaction.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-research-from-jackson-et-al.">The Research from Jackson et al.</h4>
<p>A research consortium led by Matthew Jackson, who holds the William D. Eberle Professorship of Economics within Stanford University’s School of Humanities and Sciences, conducted an empirical analysis of the behavioral and personality attributes of the AI-driven entities within ChatGPT, employing methodologies derived from psychology and behavioral economics. Their findings, documented in the paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313925121">A Turing test of whether AI chatbots are behaviorally similar to humans</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated that ChatGPT 4, exhibited indistinguishability from human participants in behavioral assessments. Notably, when the AI opted for atypical human behavioral patterns, it manifested increased levels of cooperativeness and altruism.</p>
<p>This investigative endeavor subjected versions 3 and 4 of ChatGPT to a prevalent personality assessment alongside a series of behavioral experiments designed to forecast socio-economic and ethical decision-making tendencies. These experiments encompassed standardized scenarios that required participants to make choices on dilemmas such as betraying a complicit criminal or allocating monetary resources under various incentive structures. The AI responses were benchmarked against a dataset comprising over 100,000 human participants spanning 50 nations.</p>
<p>Within the OCEAN Big-5, ChatGPT version 4 aligned with the normal human range for these traits but ranked in the lower third percentile in terms of agreeableness compared to the human sample. Despite passing the Turing Test, this level of agreeableness suggests limited social appeal.</p>

<figcaption>“Big Five” personality profiles of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 compared with the distributions of human subjects. The blue, orange, and green lines correspond to the median scores of humans, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-3 respectively; the shaded areas represent the middle 95% of the scores, across each of the dimensions. ChatGPT’s personality profiles are within the range of the human distribution, even though ChatGPT-3 scored noticeably lower in Openness.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Comparative analysis between versions 3 and 4 revealed significant advancements in the latter’s performance, with version 3 displaying agreeableness and openness to experience at the lower end of the human spectrum, indicative of a lesser capacity for novel ideas and experiences.</p>
<p>The methodology for assessing AI behavior in the experimental games involved calculating the frequency of specific actions (e.g., equitable distribution of funds) among both human participants and the AI. Subsequently, the researchers compared a randomly selected human action to one from the AI sessions to ascertain the likelihood of human origin. In the majority of these exercises, actions taken by version 4 were more consistently aligned with human behavior than those of version 3, which did not meet the Turing Test criteria.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-on-work">Impact on Work</h3>
<p>The study <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-013_d9b45b68-9e74-42d6-a1c6-c72fb70c7282.pdf">Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality</a> by Dell’Acqua et al.&nbsp;explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, on the productivity and quality of work among knowledge workers at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). This comprehensive experiment involved 758 consultants and aimed to understand how AI affects complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.</p>

<p><img src="https://antomon.github.io/posts/gpt-4-anniversary/Distribution-output-quality.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Distribution of output quality across all the tasks" width="900"></p>
<figcaption>Distribution of output quality across all the tasks. The blue group did not use AI, the green and red groups used AI, the red group got some additional training on how to use AI</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The study introduces the concept of a “jagged technological frontier,” suggesting that AI capabilities are uneven across different tasks. Some tasks are significantly enhanced by AI, leading to improved productivity and quality, while others, seemingly similar in difficulty, lie outside AI’s current capabilities and can lead to decreased performance when AI is utilized.</p>
<p>Participants were divided into three groups: a control group with no AI access, a group with access to GPT-4, and a group with GPT-4 access plus a prompt engineering overview. The findings revealed that for tasks within AI’s capabilities, the use of AI led to a notable increase in both the quantity and quality of work. Consultants were able to complete more tasks and with better outcomes, demonstrating that AI can be a powerful tool for augmenting human capabilities in knowledge work.</p>
<p>However, for tasks selected to be outside the AI’s frontier, reliance on AI resulted in a decrease in performance. This highlights the importance of understanding AI’s limitations and suggests that indiscriminate use of AI can have negative consequences.</p>
<p>The study also observed two distinct patterns of AI integration among successful users: “Centaurs,” who strategically divided tasks between themselves and AI, and “Cyborgs,” who integrated AI more fully into their workflow. These findings suggest varying approaches to integrating AI into professional tasks, emphasizing the need for users to adapt their strategies based on the task at hand and AI’s capabilities.</p>
<p>In summary, the study provides empirical evidence on the dual role of AI in enhancing and sometimes detracting from professional knowledge work. It highlights the need for careful consideration of when and how to deploy AI tools, as well as the potential for AI to significantly impact work processes and outcomes within its capabilities. The concept of the jagged technological frontier offers a framework for understanding the complex and evolving relationship between AI and human work, underscoring the importance of navigating this frontier effectively to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks.</p>

<p>The capability of Command-R to utilize external tools marks a significant advancement for developers in the corporate sector. This feature permits the model to link with external resources such as search engines, APIs, databases, and functions, thereby enriching its functionality through the utilization of data and operations available via these tools. This aspect is especially beneficial for businesses that store a substantial portion of their data in external repositories.</p>
<p>The adoption of tool usage opens the door to a broad spectrum of new applications. For example, developers can instruct Command-R to suggest a specific tool or a combination thereof, along with guidance on their usage. This enables chatbots to interact with customer relationship management (CRM) systems to update deal statuses or to employ Python interpreters for performing data science tasks. Additionally, it allows for the transformation of user inquiries into search commands for vector databases or search engines, empowering work assistants to autonomously navigate through various databases and platforms to gather pertinent information or execute comparative evaluations.</p>
<p>Tool usage with Command-R involves a four-stage process: initially, developers configure which tools the model can access and the format of interactions (e.g., API calls, JSON-formatted instructions). Command-R then judiciously selects the suitable tools and parameters for these interactions. Subsequently, developers execute these tool interactions, obtaining results, which are then fed back into Command-R to generate the final response.</p>

<section id="genai-a-venezia" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="genai-a-venezia">GenAI a Venezia</h2>
<p>Bel pomeriggio presso l’Università Ca’ Foscari di Venezia, ospite del Dipartimento di Economia e dell’evento DABS Day 2024.</p>
<p>Coll’intervento di apertura dell’evento, ho portato una serie di spunti sulla intelligenza artificiale generativa, utili al confronto con i ragazzi, gli altri ospiti e il corpo docente.</p>
<p>Il talk è stato organizzato in 4 sezioni:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Il contesto: Aspettative tra alti e bassi. Un breve excursus storico per arrivare alla rivouluzione del deep learning e dei transformer.</p></li>
<li><p>Le promesse: sarà un estate perenne? La principale promessa della fase storica corrente e cioè la polivalenza dei nuovi modelli di reti neurali generative.</p></li>
<li><p>Le sfide: grandi guadagni, grandi rischi. La rivoluzione della IA generativa porta con sé molte sfide, tutte proporzionali alle promesse e alle aspettative suscitate.</p></li>
<li><p>Il futuro: IA importante come fuoco per l’umanità. Difficile trovare una metafora per definire l’impatto della IA generativa sull’umanità, ma il fuoco sembra essere la migliore per il CEO di Alphabet (vedi anche mio altro <a href="https://antomon.github.io/posts/ai-important-as-fire/">post</a> sul tema). Quindi, rivolgo uno sguardo alle rivoluzioni tecnologiche precedenti e riporto alcune raccomandazioni per il presente e il futuro prossimo.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduzione">Introduzione</h2>
<p>Un cliente aveva qualche migliaia di Partite IVA europee da controllare e la sindrome del buon samaritano mi ha costretto a spolverare il VBA per poter sfruttare lo strumento client più amato nelle aziende: Excel!</p>
<p>Questa guida, pertanto, ti mostra come utilizzare un file Excel per controllare la validità delle Partite IVA tramite il servizio <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation"><strong>VIES</strong></a> (VAT Information Exchange System).</p>
<p>Il post è diviso in due parti: la prima è pensata per gli utenti che non hanno esperienza di programmazione, ma hanno un minimo di conoscenza di Excel e la seconda è per chi ha conoscenze di base in <strong>VBA</strong> e vuole modificare o personalizzare il file Excel o il codice.</p>

<li><p><strong>Apri il file Excel</strong>: Assicurati di scaricare e aprire il file <a href="CONTROLLO-PARTITE-IVA-CON-VIES.xlsm">Excel</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inserisci i dati delle Partite IVA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vai al foglio specificato nella cella <strong>B3</strong> del foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In questo foglio troverai le seguenti colonne:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonna A (CODICE PAESE)</strong>: Inserisci il codice del paese (es. IT per Italia, FR per Francia, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Colonna B (P.IVA)</strong>: Inserisci il numero di Partita IVA da controllare.</li>
<li><strong>Colonna C (ESITO CONTROLLO CON VIES)</strong>: I risultati del controllo effettuato tramite il servizio VIES appariranno qui.</li>
<li><strong>Colonna D (ESITO CONTROLLO SINTATTICO (NON LIMITANTE))</strong>: Qui verrà riportato il risultato del controllo sintattico della Partita IVA, ovvero se il formato è valido o meno, basato su una regex (non blocca l’esecuzione del controllo VIES).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Clicca sul bottone per eseguire il controllo</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nel foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>, troverai un bottone a forma di <strong>triangolo nero</strong>, simile al tasto “Play” di un lettore multimediale.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clicca sul bottone</strong> per avviare il controllo delle Partite IVA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpreta i risultati</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Una volta avviato il controllo, i risultati verranno visualizzati:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonna C</strong>: Mostra il risultato del controllo tramite il servizio VIES.</li>
<li><strong>Colonna D</strong>: Mostra se il formato della Partita IVA è valido o meno (controllo sintattico). Se il controllo sintattico è positivo, apparirà “Valida”, se è negativo apparirà “Non valida”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Alla fine del processo, comparirà una <strong>finestra di riepilogo</strong> che mostra il numero totale di Partite IVA controllate, quante sono risultate valide o non valide, gli errori riscontrati, e le Partite IVA vuote.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="riepilogo-dei-messaggi">Riepilogo dei messaggi</h3>
<p>Al termine dell’esecuzione, il sistema visualizzerà una finestra di dialogo che mostrerà il seguente riepilogo:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Numero di P.IVA controllate</strong>: Numero totale di Partite IVA processate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Valide in VIES</strong>: Partite IVA che risultano valide dopo il controllo con il servizio VIES.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non valide in VIES</strong>: Partite IVA che risultano non valide nel servizio VIES (potrebbero non essere registrate o essere errate).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Errori</strong>: Numero di errori riscontrati durante il controllo (ad esempio, problemi con il servizio VIES o con i dati).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vuote</strong>: Numero di righe in cui la Partita IVA non era presente o la cella era vuota.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficienza</strong>: Velocità di controllo espressa in Partite IVA per minuto.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personalizzare-e-modificare-il-codice">Personalizzare e modificare il codice</h2>
<p>Questa sezione è pensata per chi ha già una conoscenza di base di <strong>VBA</strong> e desidera personalizzare o modificare il codice VBA per adattarlo alle proprie necessità.</p>
<section id="struttura-del-codice" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="struttura-del-codice">Struttura del Codice</h3>
<p>Il codice VBA esegue principalmente due controlli:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Validazione del formato della Partita IVA</strong>: Utilizza un’espressione regolare (regex) per verificare che il formato della Partita IVA sia conforme alle regole del paese.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Controllo tramite VIES</strong>: Invia una richiesta al servizio VIES per verificare se la Partita IVA è valida.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="come-modificare-il-codice-vba" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="come-modificare-il-codice-vba">Come modificare il codice VBA</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Aprire l’editor VBA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Premi <code>ALT + F11</code> per aprire l’editor VBA.</p></li>
<li><p>Nel pannello a sinistra, troverai un modulo chiamato <strong>Modulo1</strong> o simile. Qui è contenuto tutto il codice.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Controllo sintattico</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Il controllo sintattico del formato della Partita IVA non blocca il controllo tramite VIES. Anche se il controllo fallisce (ad esempio, se il formato è errato), la richiesta al servizio VIES verrà comunque effettuata. Il risultato del controllo sintattico viene inserito nella <strong>Colonna D (ESITO CONTROLLO SINTATTICO (NON LIMITANTE))</strong>. Se il formato è valido, apparirà “Valida”, altrimenti “Non valida”.</p>
</section>
<section id="modifica" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modifica">Modifica</h3>
<p>Se desideri modificare o aggiungere una regex per un nuovo paese, segui questi passaggi:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Vai nel foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inserisci il <strong>codice del paese</strong> nella colonna A (es. “PT” per il Portogallo).</p></li>
<li><p>Inserisci il pattern <strong>regex</strong> corretto nella colonna B per validare il formato delle Partite IVA del paese specifico (ad esempio, per il Portogallo, potrebbe essere <code>^\d{9}$</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Salva e chiudi.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Il codice VBA utilizzerà automaticamente la regex inserita per validare il formato delle Partite IVA per quel paese.</p>
<p>Altre configurazioni:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Numero massimo di righe da controllare</strong>: Se nella cella <strong>B1</strong> del foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong> non viene inserito un valore, la macro controllerà tutte le righe con Partite IVA fino alla prima riga vuota. Se viene inserito un numero, controllerà solo quel numero di righe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Codice paese predefinito</strong>: Se una Partita IVA non ha un codice paese associato (colonna A vuota), verrà usato il codice predefinito specificato nella cella <strong>B2</strong> del foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Questa guida ti permette di utilizzare un file Excel per controllare le Partite IVA europee tramite il servizio VIES. Se sei un utente che non ha familiarità con la programmazione, puoi facilmente utilizzare il file cliccando semplicemente su un bottone. Se hai invece conoscenze di VBA, puoi personalizzare il codice o modificare il file per adattarlo meglio alle tue esigenze specifiche, come l’aggiunta di nuovi paesi o la modifica dei messaggi restituiti.</p>
<p>In questo modo, puoi automatizzare il controllo delle Partite IVA e risparmiare tempo nella gestione dei dati aziendali.</p>
