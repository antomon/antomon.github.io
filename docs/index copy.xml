<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>We are living through one of the most exhilarating moments in the history of technology. Every day, breakthroughs in machine learning, data pipelines, automation, and edge computing redefine the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
<p>For me, being an <strong>interim manager</strong> in this landscape is not just a job, it’s a creative calling, a unique opportunity to shape the future of how businesses operate, grow, and thrive.</p>
<p>I don’t just help companies “go digital.” I help them reimagine what they <em>can become</em>. My work is about turning vision into architecture, uncertainty into opportunity, and potential into working systems. I bring together <strong>strategy and execution, architecture and operations, culture and code</strong>.</p>
<p>And in this era, where AI reshapes every domain it touches, I see my role as both <strong>builder and guide</strong>—someone who can sketch the future at the enterprise level and then lead the team that gets us there, step by step, sprint by sprint.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-architecture-to-transformation">From architecture to transformation</h2>
<p>Enterprise architecture is often misunderstood as a governance-heavy discipline, focused on documentation and frameworks. For me, architecture is a <strong>compass for transformation</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s the lens that connects <strong>vision to execution</strong>, ensuring that every decision—from data models to ERP rollout, from cloud adoption to cybersecurity posture—aligns with strategic intent.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve blended <strong>TOGAF, ArchiMate, design thinking, Agile, and DevOps</strong> into what I call <em>adaptive architecture</em>: a practical way to drive clarity and momentum without drowning in methodology.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Architecture, for me, is not just about artifacts. It’s about <strong>narratives that create alignment</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s not just about current and target states. It’s about <strong>roadmaps that organizations can walk, even in uncertainty</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s not just governance. It’s <strong>transformation scaffolding</strong>, holding complexity in place until change becomes natural.</p></li>

  <title>Simulating Tethered Buoy Dynamics</title>
  <dc:creator>Antonio Montano</dc:creator>
  <link>https://antomon.github.io/posts/tethered-buoy-dynamics/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A few days ago, I received a fresh citation notification referencing an article titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10256">“On the use of an advanced Kirchhoff rod model to study mooring lines”</a>. That small note sparked a surge of memories from the intense period when I was searching for a stable, accurate way to model a tethered buoy system. It seemed like the perfect moment to revisit a project that, for me, was marked by long stretches of frustration and the pure joy of each breakthrough.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable how twenty years can deepen one’s perspective on a project as intricate and rewarding as simulating a tethered buoy system. I initially aimed to model a buoy afloat on the ocean surface, secured by a cable so stiff that it scarcely stretched under large tension. Over the years, I’ve watched that early spark of curiosity evolve into a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and practical details essential to making it all work. Despite countless hours testing equations, running simulations, and honing algorithms, this endeavor remains among the most gratifying I’ve undertaken.</p>

<section id="the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Mixed finite elements emerged as the linchpin for dealing with a cable of extremely high Young’s modulus. In a more standard approach, tension might be computed strictly as a derivative of displacement, a method prone to severe numerical instability, especially when the model was pushed close to its inextensible limit. By employing a strategy akin to incompressible fluid simulations, in which pressure is treated separately from velocity, we disentangled tension from displacement. This demanded meticulous algebraic checks, careful boundary condition enforcement, and diverse validation tests. Yet the outcome was a stable formulation capable of handling real-world cable stiffness. It often reminded me of fluid mechanics, where treating pressure as an independent variable helps circumvent the pitfalls of near-incompressibility.</p>
<p>Quaternion-based buoy motion posed a similarly unconventional challenge. Large, abrupt rotations from rough seas or vigorous currents made Euler angles precarious—one intense swing could trigger numerical lockups or cause the entire orientation model to fail. By turning to quaternions, although less common in many engineering circles at the time, we found a smooth, singularity-free representation of every possible orientation in three-dimensional space. We tested the approach with simulations of tempest-level storms and sharp angle changes to confirm that the buoy’s motion stayed plausible. Repeatedly, quaternions rose to the occasion, allowing the buoy’s full rotational dynamics to unfold without numerical breakdown.</p>
<p>Implicit time-stepping formed the final cornerstone of our method. A cable on the brink of inextensibility transmits wave forces at high speeds, rendering an explicit solver prohibitively slow due to the tiny time steps required for stability. We chose a backward Euler scheme, tackling a large-scale, nonlinear system at each time increment. To manage the complexity, we turned to a damped Newton method, iterating on a solution guess while tuning the damping for smooth convergence. Though heavier computationally, this allowed for significantly larger time steps and a practical balance between accuracy and runtime. In numerous experiments, once the Newton iterations converged, the results were physically coherent and free of the instabilities we had feared.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-results">The results</h2>
<p>Armed with these three pillars, we investigated diverse scenarios, from cables so stiff they bordered on rigid to longer, more flexible lines. We included realistic wave heights, wind speeds, and currents typical of commercial mooring installations. Observing the buoy’s subtle rocking, dramatic heaving, and swirling rotations underscored how the system responded to external forces. Each validation run comparing our data with known behavior reinforced confidence that we had captured the essential physics.</p>
<p>Even when we dialed stiffness to extremes, the simulation avoided catastrophic instability. Our mixed formulation for cable tension and displacement, coupled with an implicit time stepper, maintained a consistent evolution from step to step. Simultaneously, quaternions let us depict conditions ranging from tranquil seas, with mild buoy bobbing, to rough waters involving severe pitching and rolling. Feedback from industry contacts affirmed that these capabilities opened valuable avenues for mooring design, especially under extreme weather or when safeguarding delicate equipment on the buoy deck. By matching simulations to real-world observations—like how far a buoy might drift under heavy seas—we significantly bolstered trust in our overall approach.</p>
<p>In the end, the model bridged a gap between purely theoretical inquiry and the concrete engineering tasks that oceanographers, marine engineers, and equipment designers face. Running multi-day or even multi-week simulations without exorbitant computational overhead was an exciting prospect. This was no longer a mere academic puzzle; it was a practical tool likely to inform how mooring lines are specified, built, and managed, whether for scientific stations or navigation beacons in high-traffic waters.</p>

<p>This project also unified my engineering approach to physics and mathematics in a problem that originated from a company that, to this day, continues to produce buoys. The challenge wasn’t just academic; it was a real-world issue that required scientific rigor to solve. The culmination of our work was published in <strong>Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering</strong> under the title <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2007.04.012">Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Tethered Buoy Dynamics</a></strong>, co-authored with Marco Restelli and Riccardo Sacco. The publication validated our approach and demonstrated that tackling practical engineering problems with strong theoretical foundations could yield robust and widely applicable solutions.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back">Looking back</h2>
<p>Reflecting on this project, I’m amazed at the breadth of expertise required. We merged advanced finite element theories, wave force modeling, buoy geometry, and fluid–structure interaction, all in a single system. Yes, we faced frustrating snags—bug hunts that stretched late into the night or solver conflicts that cropped up unexpectedly—but each resolution felt like a tangible stride toward a robust, trustworthy model.</p>
<p>The satisfaction stands out most vividly. Every instance of pushing the model—testing bigger waves, trickier cables, or new geometric nuances—brought the thrill of seeing it hold firm. The mathematics we’d nurtured for so long manifested as on-screen visualizations of swirling seawater, with a buoy steadily riding the crests and troughs. It was then that I realized we had transcended theoretical musings, delivering a resource for engineers, researchers, and maritime professionals alike.</p>
<p>Two decades on, I still regard it as a testament to collaboration, persistence, and solid mathematical foundations. Tackling problems of this scope often demands stepping beyond familiar territory, whether by redefining tension as a separate unknown or adopting quaternions for orientation. My hope is that others may glean encouragement from our experiences, confident that even though the road is strewn with roadblocks and late-night coding trials, a thoroughly validated, widely beneficial system makes it all worthwhile.</p>
<p>I should also underline how indispensable the MOX environment at Politecnico di Milano was. The department teemed with resourceful researchers who offered both theoretical knowledge and practical engineering insight. They possessed a rare knack for fusing advanced mathematical techniques with real-world requirements, their open-minded spirit inspiring each brainstorming session. Working there meant a stream of fresh ideas, incisive critiques, and the kind of camaraderie that keeps tough projects alive.</p>
<p>To this day, nothing pleases me more than receiving word of a fresh citation or reference to our work. Each new mention affirms that the methods we pieced together continue to serve those who grapple with similarly challenging scenarios. That ongoing relevance speaks volumes about the enduring value of thorough research, well beyond the date of publication.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="it-feels-like-a-lifetime-but-its-only-been-a-year" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="it-feels-like-a-lifetime-but-its-only-been-a-year">It feels like a lifetime, but it’s only been a year!</h2>
<p>March 2023 marked a turning point in the field of artificial intelligence with the release of <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">OpenAI’s GPT-4</a>. This powerful language model, boasting significant advancements over its predecessors, sent shockwaves through various industries and ignited discussions about the future of human-machine interaction. One year later, it’s clear that GPT-4’s impact has been wide-ranging and continues to evolve.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the most notable effects has been the acceleration of AI acceptance. GPT-4’s ability to perform exceptionally on standardized tests, generate human-quality writing, and integrate seamlessly with multimodal data like images and sound, has fostered a sense of legitimacy for large language models. This has emboldened researchers and businesses to explore AI applications with greater confidence.</p>
<p>In the course of evaluating the competencies of GPT-4, OpenAI subjected the model to a series of standardized academic and professional examinations, including the Uniform Bar Exam, the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Quantitative section, and assorted Advanced Placement (AP) subject tests. GPT-4 demonstrated proficiency across numerous assessments, achieving scores comparable to those of human test-takers. This implies that, were GPT-4 to be evaluated purely on its capacity to perform on these tests, it would possess the qualifications to gain admission into law schools and a broad range of universities.</p>

<p>Prior LLMs often struggled with tasks requiring an understanding of context spread across long stretches of text. With a context windows from 8k to 32k tokens, GPT-4 was able to analyze a much larger chunk of text, allowing it to grasp complex relationships between ideas and follow long-range dependencies.</p>
<p>On September 25th, 2023, OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card">announced</a> the rollout of two new features that extend how people can interact with its recent and most advanced model, GPT-4: the ability to ask questions about images and to use speech as an input to a query. Then, on November 6th, 2023, OpenAI announced API access to GPT-4 with Vision. This functionality marked GPT-4’s move into being a multimodal model. This means that the model can accept multiple “modalities” of input – text and images – and return results based on those inputs.</p>
<p>After a year, GPT-4 remains one of the most advanced LLMs, even though the competition is fierce and with formidable opponents. If the rumors are confirmed, in the coming months we will have an even more powerful version that will continue to amaze us, just like the previous ones.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-about">What is about</h4>
<p>The Turing Test, introduced by British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, is a benchmark for evaluating a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. In his seminal paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing proposed the question, “Can machines think?” and introduced the concept of the “imitation game” as a criterion for machine intelligence. The test involves a human judge engaging in natural language conversations with both a machine and a human without seeing them. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test. This test has become a fundamental concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, sparking debates about the nature of intelligence and the potential of machines to emulate human-like consciousness and reasoning.</p>
<p>The Turing Test’s significance lies in its simplicity and profound implications. It provides a straightforward criterion for intelligence that does not rely on the machine’s ability to replicate the human brain’s workings but rather on the outcome of its interactions. Passing the Turing Test is considered a milestone for AI, suggesting that the machine can replicate human-like responses under certain conditions, thereby challenging the distinctions between human and machine intelligence.</p>

<li><p><strong>Conscientiousness</strong>: Involves self-discipline, orderliness, and a drive for achievement. Highly conscientious individuals are organized and responsible, often with a strong work ethic. Lower scores may indicate a more relaxed or spontaneous approach to life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraversion</strong>: Denotes sociability, excitement-seeking, and positive emotions. Extroverts are typically energetic and enjoy being around other people, while introverts (lower extraversion) may prefer solitude and more subdued environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agreeableness</strong>: Reflects a person’s altruistic, cooperative, and compassionate nature. High agreeableness is associated with trust and helpfulness, whereas lower agreeableness may manifest as skepticism or competitive behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neuroticism</strong>: Pertains to emotional stability and the tendency to experience negative emotions. Higher neuroticism scores indicate a greater likelihood of feeling anxious, depressed, or angry, while lower scores suggest a calmer and more resilient disposition.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These traits provide a framework for understanding human personality and predicting a wide range of behaviors, from academic and occupational success to relationships and well-being. In the context of AI, applying the OCEAN Big-5 to evaluate chatbots like ChatGPT allows researchers to assess how closely these systems mimic human personality traits, contributing to the ongoing exploration of machine “personality” and its implications for human-AI interaction.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-research-from-jackson-et-al.">The Research from Jackson et al.</h4>
<p>A research consortium led by Matthew Jackson, who holds the William D. Eberle Professorship of Economics within Stanford University’s School of Humanities and Sciences, conducted an empirical analysis of the behavioral and personality attributes of the AI-driven entities within ChatGPT, employing methodologies derived from psychology and behavioral economics. Their findings, documented in the paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2313925121">A Turing test of whether AI chatbots are behaviorally similar to humans</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated that ChatGPT 4, exhibited indistinguishability from human participants in behavioral assessments. Notably, when the AI opted for atypical human behavioral patterns, it manifested increased levels of cooperativeness and altruism.</p>
<p>This investigative endeavor subjected versions 3 and 4 of ChatGPT to a prevalent personality assessment alongside a series of behavioral experiments designed to forecast socio-economic and ethical decision-making tendencies. These experiments encompassed standardized scenarios that required participants to make choices on dilemmas such as betraying a complicit criminal or allocating monetary resources under various incentive structures. The AI responses were benchmarked against a dataset comprising over 100,000 human participants spanning 50 nations.</p>
<p>Within the OCEAN Big-5, ChatGPT version 4 aligned with the normal human range for these traits but ranked in the lower third percentile in terms of agreeableness compared to the human sample. Despite passing the Turing Test, this level of agreeableness suggests limited social appeal.</p>

<figcaption>“Big Five” personality profiles of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3 compared with the distributions of human subjects. The blue, orange, and green lines correspond to the median scores of humans, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-3 respectively; the shaded areas represent the middle 95% of the scores, across each of the dimensions. ChatGPT’s personality profiles are within the range of the human distribution, even though ChatGPT-3 scored noticeably lower in Openness.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Comparative analysis between versions 3 and 4 revealed significant advancements in the latter’s performance, with version 3 displaying agreeableness and openness to experience at the lower end of the human spectrum, indicative of a lesser capacity for novel ideas and experiences.</p>
<p>The methodology for assessing AI behavior in the experimental games involved calculating the frequency of specific actions (e.g., equitable distribution of funds) among both human participants and the AI. Subsequently, the researchers compared a randomly selected human action to one from the AI sessions to ascertain the likelihood of human origin. In the majority of these exercises, actions taken by version 4 were more consistently aligned with human behavior than those of version 3, which did not meet the Turing Test criteria.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-on-work">Impact on Work</h3>
<p>The study <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/24-013_d9b45b68-9e74-42d6-a1c6-c72fb70c7282.pdf">Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality</a> by Dell’Acqua et al.&nbsp;explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, on the productivity and quality of work among knowledge workers at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). This comprehensive experiment involved 758 consultants and aimed to understand how AI affects complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Distribution of output quality across all the tasks. The blue group did not use AI, the green and red groups used AI, the red group got some additional training on how to use AI</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The study introduces the concept of a “jagged technological frontier,” suggesting that AI capabilities are uneven across different tasks. Some tasks are significantly enhanced by AI, leading to improved productivity and quality, while others, seemingly similar in difficulty, lie outside AI’s current capabilities and can lead to decreased performance when AI is utilized.</p>
<p>Participants were divided into three groups: a control group with no AI access, a group with access to GPT-4, and a group with GPT-4 access plus a prompt engineering overview. The findings revealed that for tasks within AI’s capabilities, the use of AI led to a notable increase in both the quantity and quality of work. Consultants were able to complete more tasks and with better outcomes, demonstrating that AI can be a powerful tool for augmenting human capabilities in knowledge work.</p>
<p>However, for tasks selected to be outside the AI’s frontier, reliance on AI resulted in a decrease in performance. This highlights the importance of understanding AI’s limitations and suggests that indiscriminate use of AI can have negative consequences.</p>
<p>The study also observed two distinct patterns of AI integration among successful users: “Centaurs,” who strategically divided tasks between themselves and AI, and “Cyborgs,” who integrated AI more fully into their workflow. These findings suggest varying approaches to integrating AI into professional tasks, emphasizing the need for users to adapt their strategies based on the task at hand and AI’s capabilities.</p>
<p>In summary, the study provides empirical evidence on the dual role of AI in enhancing and sometimes detracting from professional knowledge work. It highlights the need for careful consideration of when and how to deploy AI tools, as well as the potential for AI to significantly impact work processes and outcomes within its capabilities. The concept of the jagged technological frontier offers a framework for understanding the complex and evolving relationship between AI and human work, underscoring the importance of navigating this frontier effectively to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks.</p>

<p>The capability of Command-R to utilize external tools marks a significant advancement for developers in the corporate sector. This feature permits the model to link with external resources such as search engines, APIs, databases, and functions, thereby enriching its functionality through the utilization of data and operations available via these tools. This aspect is especially beneficial for businesses that store a substantial portion of their data in external repositories.</p>
<p>The adoption of tool usage opens the door to a broad spectrum of new applications. For example, developers can instruct Command-R to suggest a specific tool or a combination thereof, along with guidance on their usage. This enables chatbots to interact with customer relationship management (CRM) systems to update deal statuses or to employ Python interpreters for performing data science tasks. Additionally, it allows for the transformation of user inquiries into search commands for vector databases or search engines, empowering work assistants to autonomously navigate through various databases and platforms to gather pertinent information or execute comparative evaluations.</p>
<p>Tool usage with Command-R involves a four-stage process: initially, developers configure which tools the model can access and the format of interactions (e.g., API calls, JSON-formatted instructions). Command-R then judiciously selects the suitable tools and parameters for these interactions. Subsequently, developers execute these tool interactions, obtaining results, which are then fed back into Command-R to generate the final response.</p>

<section id="genai-a-venezia" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="genai-a-venezia">GenAI a Venezia</h2>
<p>Bel pomeriggio presso l’Università Ca’ Foscari di Venezia, ospite del Dipartimento di Economia e dell’evento DABS Day 2024.</p>
<p>Coll’intervento di apertura dell’evento, ho portato una serie di spunti sulla intelligenza artificiale generativa, utili al confronto con i ragazzi, gli altri ospiti e il corpo docente.</p>
<p>Il talk è stato organizzato in 4 sezioni:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Il contesto: Aspettative tra alti e bassi. Un breve excursus storico per arrivare alla rivouluzione del deep learning e dei transformer.</p></li>
<li><p>Le promesse: sarà un estate perenne? La principale promessa della fase storica corrente e cioè la polivalenza dei nuovi modelli di reti neurali generative.</p></li>
<li><p>Le sfide: grandi guadagni, grandi rischi. La rivoluzione della IA generativa porta con sé molte sfide, tutte proporzionali alle promesse e alle aspettative suscitate.</p></li>
<li><p>Il futuro: IA importante come fuoco per l’umanità. Difficile trovare una metafora per definire l’impatto della IA generativa sull’umanità, ma il fuoco sembra essere la migliore per il CEO di Alphabet (vedi anche mio altro <a href="https://antomon.github.io/posts/ai-important-as-fire/">post</a> sul tema). Quindi, rivolgo uno sguardo alle rivoluzioni tecnologiche precedenti e riporto alcune raccomandazioni per il presente e il futuro prossimo.</p></li>

  <title>Singletons in Python</title>
  <dc:creator>Antonio Montano</dc:creator>
  <link>https://antomon.github.io/posts/python-singleton/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Before diving into different implementations of a Python <strong>singleton</strong>, it’s essential to understand the concept from both theoretical and practical perspectives.</p>
<section id="what-is-a-design-pattern" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-design-pattern">What is a design pattern?</h2>
<p>A <strong>design pattern</strong> is a reusable solution to common problems that software developers encounter during application development. It represents best practices for addressing recurring design challenges, enabling developers to write code that is more flexible, maintainable, and reusable. Design patterns also provide a common vocabulary for designers and developers to communicate their approaches to solving software design problems.</p>
<p>Design patterns can be categorized into three main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creational patterns: Focus on object creation, optimizing efficiency and controlling how instances are instantiated. Examples include singleton, Factory Method, Builder, Prototype, and Abstract Factory.</p></li>
<li><p>Structural patterns: Deal with object composition, ensuring that relationships between components are efficient and effective. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, and Proxy.</p></li>
<li><p>Behavioral patterns: Define how objects interact and communicate with each other. Examples include Strategy, Observer, Command, State, and Iterator.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="what-is-a-creational-design-pattern" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-creational-design-pattern">What is a creational design pattern?</h2>
<p>A <strong>creational design pattern</strong> focuses on how objects are created, helping developers manage complex instantiation processes in a more adaptable and reusable manner. By abstracting the object creation process, creational patterns allow the code to be more flexible and maintainable. Some common creational design patterns include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide the specific type of object to create.</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the construction process to produce different outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p>Prototype: Creates new objects by copying an existing instance, which serves as a prototype.</p></li>
<li><p>Singleton: Ensures that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to that instance.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-on-singletons">More on singletons</h2>
<p>The <strong>singleton pattern</strong> serves two primary purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ensure that a class has only one instance: The main goal of the singleton pattern is to control the number of instances of a class. This pattern is particularly useful when managing shared resources, such as database connections or configuration files. If an object already exists, any subsequent request to create the class should return the existing instance.</p>
<p>This behavior cannot be easily implemented using a typical constructor, as constructors are designed to return new objects each time they are invoked.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a global access point to the instance: The singleton pattern also allows the instance to be accessed globally, similar to a global variable. However, unlike global variables, the singleton pattern ensures that the instance cannot be accidentally overwritten or modified by other parts of the code, reducing the risk of errors and crashes.</p>
<p>By encapsulating the logic that guarantees a single instance within the class itself, the code remains more organized and consistent.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So, the singleton pattern is especially helpful when dealing with shared resources, where having multiple instances would lead to inefficiency, resource conflicts, or inconsistencies.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-implementation">Naive implementation</h3>
<p>A basic singleton can be implemented by keeping track of whether an instance has already been created. If an instance exists, any request for a new instance will return the existing one. This approach provides a global point of access to shared resources. Here is a simple implementation of a singleton in Python:</p>

<section id="disadvantages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<p>While the singleton pattern offers advantages like centralized control and resource efficiency, it also has some notable downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increased Coupling: Since singletons provide a global point of access, they can increase coupling between different components of an application. This can make refactoring or isolating parts of the system for testing more challenging.</p></li>
<li><p>Global State: Introducing a global state can lead to unpredictable behavior, making it difficult to track changes and understand the state of the application.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing Challenges: Singletons can complicate testing because enforcing a single instance can make it difficult to create isolated testing scenarios or simulate different states.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these potential issues, some developers view the singleton pattern as an antipattern and recommend using it only when its benefits outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

<section id="single-responsibility-principle" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="single-responsibility-principle">Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
<p>The <strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</strong> is one of the SOLID principles<sup>1</sup> of object-oriented design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility or function within the system.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The SOLID principles are a set of five fundamental design guidelines aimed at making software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The acronym <strong>SOLID</strong> stands for: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as <em>Uncle Bob</em>, in the early 2000s. They have become a cornerstone in object-oriented design and programming, promoting best practices that help developers build robust and scalable software systems.See Martin, R. C. (2002). <em>Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices</em>. Prentice Hall. ISBN: 978-0135974445.</p></div></div><p>Singletons often violate SRP because they typically serve two distinct purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Managing their own instance: The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created, and this instance management logic is built into the class itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Providing functional behavior: In addition to managing their own instance, singleton classes also provide functionality related to their main purpose (e.g., logging, configuration management, etc.).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By combining both instance management and functional behavior, a singleton class is taking on more than one responsibility, which violates SRP. This dual responsibility can lead to increased complexity, reduced maintainability, and challenges when attempting to test or extend the class.</p>

<p>In this implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>SingletonBase</code> class ensures that only one instance of any subclass is created by maintaining a dictionary (<code>_instances</code>) of instances.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Logger</code> class inherits from <code>SingletonBase</code>, resulting in shared behavior and a single instance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is useful when multiple classes need to follow the singleton pattern, allowing for reuse of the singleton logic.</p>

<section id="what-is-a-decorator" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-decorator">What is a decorator?</h4>
<p>A <strong>decorator</strong> in Python is a function that allows you to modify the behavior of another function or class without changing its code. Decorators provide a clean, readable way to extend functionality by “wrapping” a function or class, making it easy to add behavior dynamically.</p>
<p>Decorators are commonly used in web frameworks to handle concerns like authentication, logging, and caching. They are an effective way to separate cross-cutting concerns from the main logic of a function, leading to more organized and maintainable code.</p>
<p>Below is an example of using a decorator to log function calls:</p>

<p>In this example, the <code>Logger</code> class is decorated with <code>@ensure_single_instance</code>. As a result, both <code>logger1</code> and <code>logger2</code> refer to the same instance, demonstrating the singleton behavior.</p>
<p>This approach highlights the power of combining decorators with the singleton pattern. By adding the <code>@ensure_single_instance</code> decorator, we ensure that the <code>Logger</code> class functions as a singleton, with all instances referring to the same underlying object. This simplifies the code and makes the intent explicit, enhancing readability and maintainability.</p>

<p>In this implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>SingletonMeta</code> class is a metaclass that overrides the <code>__call__</code> method. This method is responsible for creating instances of classes.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>__call__</code> method checks if an instance already exists in the <code>_instances</code> dictionary. If not, it creates a new instance and stores it. Otherwise, it returns the existing instance.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Logger</code> class uses <code>SingletonMeta</code> as its metaclass, ensuring that only one instance is ever created.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is particularly powerful because it allows you to enforce singleton behavior at the metaclass level, meaning that any class using <code>SingletonMeta</code> as its metaclass will automatically follow the singleton pattern. This approach is also more flexible and reusable compared to other singleton implementations.</p>
<p>Using metaclasses for singletons allows for a more Pythonic approach to instance management, especially when working with multiple classes that need to follow the singleton pattern.</p>

<section id="comparing-the-three-implementations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparing-the-three-implementations">Comparing the three implementations</h3>
<p>Each of the three implementations of the singleton pattern—using a base class, a decorator, and a metaclass—has its own advantages and use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Base class implementation: This approach is useful when multiple classes need to follow the singleton pattern. It allows for reuse of the singleton logic, as any class inheriting from the base class will automatically follow the singleton behavior. However, it introduces tight coupling with the base class, which might limit flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Decorator implementation: The decorator approach makes the intent to create a singleton explicit in the class definition. It keeps the singleton logic separate from the core functionality of the class, promoting better separation of concerns. This method is highly readable, but requires a decorator function and an additional wrapper class, which can add some complexity.</p></li>
<li><p>Metaclass implementation: Using a metaclass to enforce the singleton pattern is a powerful and Pythonic solution. It allows multiple classes to follow the singleton pattern without explicit inheritance or decoration. This approach is highly reusable and works well when you need singleton behavior across different classes without modifying each class definition. However, metaclasses can be more difficult to understand, especially for developers who are not familiar with Python’s metaclass system.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="taking-into-account-thread-safety">Taking into account thread-safety</h2>
<p>It’s crucial to understand when explicit thread safety management is needed, as it comes with a computational cost. In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, which can mitigate the need for additional thread safety in simpler scenarios. However, more advanced data structures involving non-atomic operations still require explicit thread safety with locks to prevent issues when multiple threads are accessing or modifying shared resources.</p>
<p>To make singleton implementations thread-safe, we need to ensure that multiple threads do not create multiple instances simultaneously. Below are thread-safe versions of the singleton pattern implemented using a base class, a decorator, and a metaclass.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>All three implementations ensure that the singleton instance is created in a thread-safe manner by using locks. This prevents multiple threads from creating separate instances, ensuring the singleton property holds even in concurrent environments.</p>
<p>In CPython, the reference implementation of Python, the GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This means that even without explicit locks, bytecode execution is atomic at the interpreter level, which can mitigate some thread safety concerns for simple operations. However, the GIL does not protect against all threading issues, especially when dealing with non-atomic operations or when interfacing with external systems and I/O operations. Therefore, relying solely on the GIL for thread safety is not advisable.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are proposals like <strong><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP 703</a></strong> titled <em>Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython</em>, which aim to make the GIL optional in future versions of Python. If such changes are implemented, threads could execute Python bytecode concurrently, removing the atomicity guarantees currently provided by the GIL. This would increase the importance of explicit thread safety mechanisms in your code.</p>
<p>Given these considerations, it’s important to implement explicit thread safety measures, such as locks, in your singleton implementations. This ensures that your code is robust not only in the current CPython environment but also in future Python interpreters that may not have a GIL. By proactively managing thread safety, you can prevent subtle bugs and race conditions that could occur in a truly concurrent execution environment.</p>
<p>While each singleton implementation method—base class, decorator, or metaclass—has its own strengths, the choice depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as readability, reusability, and your familiarity with Python’s advanced features like metaclasses or decorators. Regardless of the method chosen, incorporating explicit thread safety measures is crucial for maintaining the singleton property in multi-threaded applications, both now and in anticipation of future developments in Python’s concurrency model.</p>

<p>The singleton pattern is a powerful tool when used appropriately, particularly for managing shared resources like configuration settings or logging mechanisms. However, it’s important to weigh the benefits of the singleton pattern against its potential downsides. Overusing it or applying it in the wrong context can lead to design issues such as increased coupling, global state management problems, and violations of the Single Responsibility Principle.</p>
<p>The singleton pattern can be implemented in several ways, each with its pros and cons. The base class implementation is straightforward and easy to reuse but can introduce tight coupling. The decorator implementation provides clear separation of concerns and is highly readable but may add complexity due to the need for additional wrapper classes. The metaclass approach is powerful and reusable across different classes without modifying their definitions, but it may be challenging for developers who are not familiar with metaclasses.</p>
<p>In summary, while the singleton pattern is useful, its usage should be carefully considered and limited to cases where ensuring a single instance truly adds value to the application. Understanding the trade-offs of different implementations will help you make the best design decisions for your specific needs.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of computer programming, the choice of programming language significantly influences the efficiency, readability, and maintainability of software projects. Among the myriad of programming languages available, Python has emerged as a dominant force, celebrated for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. This essay posits that Python functions as an “interface language” between human cognitive processes and machine execution, thus acting as an effective medium that bridges the interaction between humans and machines.</p>
<p>The concept of an “interface language” implies that a programming language serves as a medium that not only translates human intent into machine-readable code but also abstracts the complexities of lower-level programming. Python excels in these aspects through its design philosophy, high-level abstractions, and ability to serve as a wrapper for other languages, allowing developers to leverage the substantial effort invested in building state-of-the-art software.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simplified-syntax-and-readability">Simplified syntax and readability</h3>
<p>Python’s simplified syntax and emphasis on readability make it a more human-friendly interface compared to languages like C++ or Fortran. This quality is crucial for developers aiming to solve complex problems without being bogged down by cumbersome boilerplate code or language-specific intricacies.</p>
<p>The fundamental constructs of Python, such as conditions, loops, and sequences of actions, are rooted in control flow theory, which dictates the order in which instructions are executed. These constructs are based on structured programming principles, a paradigm introduced in the late 1960s by computer scientists like Edsger Dijkstra <sup>1</sup>. Structured programming advocates the use of simple, understandable flow constructs, including sequence, selection (conditions), and iteration (loops), which enhance program clarity and reliability <sup>2</sup>.</p>

Academic Press.</p></div></div><p>In imperative programming languages like Python, control flow constructs explicitly direct the computer on how to perform tasks step-by-step, akin to giving a series of commands. This imperative nature closely mirrors how humans solve problems logically: by breaking them down into discrete steps. These basic constructs are fundamental because they allow programmers to express problem-solving processes in a structured manner, directly communicating the flow of operations to the machine.</p>
<p>Consider the following example, where Python is used to read and process a CSV file:</p>

<p>This code reads data from a CSV file and prints the ‘Name’ and ‘Age’ columns for each row, demonstrating Python’s straightforward syntax and built-in support for common file operations. The syntax is designed to be as intuitive as possible, minimizing the mental overhead required to understand and maintain code.</p>

<section id="comparison-with-human-language" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison-with-human-language">Comparison with human language</h3>
<p>Here, the comparison is with general characteristics of human languages. We specifically use English because it was the choice of Guido van Rossum, who invented Python.</p>
<section id="parallels-between-python-and-english-grammar" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parallels-between-python-and-english-grammar">Parallels between Python and English grammar</h4>
<p>A formal comparison between English grammar and Python syntax reveals several interesting parallels. In English, conditional statements often take the form of <em>If [condition], then [action], otherwise [alternative action].</em> Python follows a similar structure with its <code>if-else</code> statements. For instance, in English, we might say: <em>If it is raining, take an umbrella; otherwise, wear sunglasses.</em> In Python, this directly translates into code:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">if</span> is_raining:</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  take_umbrella()</span>
<span id="cb2-3"></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb2-5">  wear_sunglasses()</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The grammatical structure of English sentences involving conditions, loops, or sequences of actions aligns closely with Python’s keywords and syntax. Just as English uses conjunctions like <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> to combine clauses, Python uses the same words (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>) to combine logical expressions. Similarly, loops in English and Python demonstrate close parallels. In English, we might say: <em>For each item in the basket, check if it is ripe.</em> In Python, this would be represented with a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">for</span> item <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">in</span> basket:</span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">if</span> item.is_ripe():</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">print</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"Ripe item found"</span>)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Python also uses <code>while</code> loops to express repeated actions until a condition is met, akin to statements like “While it is raining, stay inside.” In Python, this would translate to:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">while</span> is_raining:</span>
<span id="cb4-2">  stay_inside()</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>These constructs allow for a direct mapping between natural language instructions and programming logic, making Python code intuitive and easier to understand.</p>
<p>In English, imperative sentences are used to issue commands, such as <em>Print the report.</em> Python similarly uses function calls to issue commands to the computer, such as <code>print("Report")</code>. This similarity makes Python code feel more intuitive, particularly to beginners, as it mirrors the structure of natural human language.</p>

<p>The syntactic model of Python can be compared to the hierarchical structures of English grammar, particularly through the concepts of hypotaxis and parataxis. In Python, the hierarchy begins with instructions, which are analogous to sentences in English. Instructions in Python contain expressions, which can be compared to clauses that convey additional meaning within a sentence. At the lowest level, tokens in Python serve as the building blocks of expressions, much like phrases or individual words contribute to the structure of a clause.</p>
<p>Hypotaxis in English refers to the use of subordinate clauses, where one part of a sentence depends on another, creating a layered, hierarchical relationship. This kind of hierarchy is reflected in Python through its use of nested code blocks, such as functions within functions, conditionals within loops, and other nested constructs. These nested relationships in Python are akin to hypotactic structures in English, where different parts of the code depend on one another, creating complexity. For example:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">if</span> condition:</span>
<span id="cb5-2">  <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">for</span> item <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">in</span> items:</span>
<span id="cb5-3">    <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">if</span> item <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&gt;</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">10</span>:</span>
<span id="cb5-4">      <span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">print</span>(item)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this example, the <code>for</code> loop and the <code>if</code> statement are subordinate to the outer <code>if</code> statement, much like dependent clauses add depth to a sentence in English.</p>
<p>In contrast, parataxis involves placing clauses side by side without subordination, often connected by conjunctions like ‘and’ or ‘but.’ In Python, this is represented by sequential code statements at the same indentation level, executed one after another without hierarchical dependency. For example:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">print</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"Start processing"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"></span>
<span id="cb6-3">process_data()</span>
<span id="cb6-4"></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><span class="bu" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">print</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"Processing complete"</span>)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here, each statement is independent, akin to paratactic clauses in English, allowing for a straightforward, linear flow of execution. This comparison highlights how Python’s syntactic model mirrors natural language constructs, making it easier for programmers to follow the logic of the code, just as readers follow the flow of a well-written sentence. The hierarchical relationship between instructions, expressions, and tokens in Python maps effectively to sentences, clauses, and phrases in English, offering a natural and intuitive way to structure both code and thought processes.</p>

<section id="readability-beyond-syntax-the-pythonic-way" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="readability-beyond-syntax-the-pythonic-way">Readability beyond syntax: the Pythonic way</h3>
<p>Another complementary aspect of Python’s design philosophy is the “Pythonic” way of writing code. This concept refers to a set of idiomatic practices that maintain a high level of readability and embody key design principles in the code itself. The notion of being Pythonic emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and conciseness—traits that align well with the language’s guiding principle that “Readability counts,” as stated in The Zen of Python by Tim Peters. Formal syntax and semantics alone do not ensure that these design principles translate into readable and clean code; the Pythonic way is needed to bridge this gap.</p>
<p>Writing Pythonic code means leveraging Python’s constructs in an elegant and efficient manner. For example, using list comprehensions instead of loops to create lists or using context managers (e.g., <code>with</code> statements) to handle resources like files results in cleaner and more maintainable code. Pythonic code often reads like a natural language description of the problem being solved, making it accessible to a broad range of developers, from beginners to experienced programmers.</p>
<p>Consider the following example, which demonstrates a Pythonic way to filter even numbers from a list:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1">numbers <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<p>This approach is preferred over a traditional loop-based solution because it is more concise and easier to understand at a glance. The Pythonic way of writing code ensures that codebases remain readable, maintainable, and aligned with Python’s core philosophy, making the language not only powerful but also enjoyable to use.</p>

<section id="python-as-a-wrapper-for-lower-level-languages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="python-as-a-wrapper-for-lower-level-languages">Python as a wrapper for lower-level languages</h2>
<p>In the preceding chapter, we saw that Python’s syntax, semantics, and best practices make it one of the easiest interfaces between humans and machines. This ease of use positions Python as an ideal language for both novice and expert developers, bridging the gap between conceptual understanding and effective software implementation.</p>
<p>Python’s strength as an “interface language” is also epitomized by its capacity to seamlessly wrap and integrate more complex programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. This functionality allows developers to employ Python as a high-level interface while leveraging the computational efficiency and fine-grained control of lower-level languages, thereby facilitating the integration of mature and highly optimized libraries without requiring direct manipulation of their intricacies. Python effectively abstracts the low-level complexity of these languages, making powerful tools and optimizations available to a broader audience of developers, including those who may not have extensive experience with system-level programming.</p>
<p>For instance, the <code>NumPy</code> library is largely implemented in C but exposes a Pythonic interface that allows users to perform advanced numerical computations without needing to write a single line of C code. This exemplifies Python’s role in making complex, highly optimized routines accessible through an easy-to-use API. Python serves as an intuitive wrapper, abstracting the complexities of optimized C code and enabling developers to concentrate on the algorithmic and structural aspects of their applications, rather than managing low-level details such as memory allocation and pointer arithmetic. This is particularly important in domains like data science, machine learning, and numerical analysis, where the focus is often on rapid prototyping and experimentation rather than dealing with intricate implementation details. The ability to interface with C/C++ allows developers to harness computational power while enjoying Python’s readability and conciseness, thereby achieving a balance between performance and development efficiency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ability to wrap lower-level languages allows Python to serve as an entry point for using sophisticated libraries that were previously accessible only to specialized developers. This accessibility has accelerated innovation across many industries, enabling researchers, scientists, and developers to leverage high-performance codebases without the need for extensive retraining. The availability of optimized, pre-existing code wrapped in Python lowers development costs, minimizes implementation time, and fosters collaboration across fields that historically relied on different programming paradigms.</p>
<section id="extending-cc-with-python" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extending-cc-with-python">Extending C/C++ with Python</h3>
<p>Python’s versatility is further demonstrated in its role as an extension mechanism for existing applications written in C or C++. By employing Python, developers can bridge performance-critical components with more flexible, higher-level program logic. Computationally intensive modules can be implemented in C or C++, while Python orchestrates the broader application. This modular approach allows developers to leverage the best aspects of both worlds: the raw performance of C/C++ and the flexibility and ease of Python.</p>
<p>Libraries such as <code>ctypes</code>, <code>cffi</code>, or tools like SWIG facilitate the seamless integration of C functions, enabling efficient interoperability and reducing development complexity by automatically generating bindings where needed. <code>ctypes</code> provides a straightforward mechanism for calling functions in shared libraries, allowing Python programs to invoke compiled C code directly. Meanwhile, <code>cffi</code> offers a more sophisticated interface, enabling developers to interface with C code in a way that is both more idiomatic and safer, ensuring type correctness and reducing potential runtime errors.</p>
<p>SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is another invaluable tool in this ecosystem, particularly when working with large and complex C/C++ codebases. It automates the generation of wrapper code, enabling Python to interact with existing C/C++ libraries with minimal manual intervention. This kind of automation is crucial in large projects, where writing bindings by hand would be prohibitively time-consuming and error-prone. The ability to combine Python with C/C++ allows for a highly adaptable workflow, where developers can optimize critical sections of their codebase without sacrificing overall productivity and maintainability.</p>
<p>This extensibility has led to widespread adoption of Python in fields such as robotics, embedded systems, and real-time computing, where high performance is often a requirement but the ease of development and rapid prototyping are also highly valued. By enabling a hybrid development model, Python empowers developers to build systems that are both powerful and flexible, with critical performance-sensitive components written in C/C++ while the overall application logic and orchestration are handled by Python. This approach not only streamlines development but also ensures that the end product is optimized for performance without compromising on maintainability.</p>

<section id="extending-fortran-with-python" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extending-fortran-with-python">Extending Fortran with Python</h3>
<p>Python also extends the reach of Fortran, a language renowned for its numerical performance, by using <code>f2py</code>, a utility within the <code>NumPy</code> ecosystem. Through <code>f2py</code>, developers can integrate high-performance Fortran routines into Python applications with minimal effort. This capability allows the combination of Fortran’s computational efficiency with Python’s readability and ease of use, creating a powerful paradigm for applications that demand both speed and maintainability.</p>
<p>Fortran has historically been the language of choice for numerical computing due to its highly optimized compilers and efficient handling of mathematical operations. By utilizing <code>f2py</code>, Python developers can invoke these well-established routines without needing to rewrite algorithms in Python or C, preserving the computational efficiency that Fortran offers. This is particularly beneficial in scientific research and high-performance computing, where existing Fortran codebases may contain decades of domain-specific optimizations that are impractical to replicate. Python, through <code>f2py</code>, effectively breathes new life into these legacy systems, allowing modern developers to build on the foundational work of earlier generations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the integration between Fortran and Python is not just about performance—it is also about accessibility. By providing a high-level interface to Fortran code, Python makes these sophisticated numerical methods accessible to researchers and scientists who may not be well-versed in Fortran but are comfortable with Python. This democratizes the use of powerful numerical tools, enabling a wider range of practitioners to leverage high-performance algorithms in their work without needing to engage with the underlying complexities of Fortran code. This synergy between Python and Fortran enhances productivity in research environments, where rapid experimentation and iteration are crucial.</p>
<p>Moreover, the combination of Python and Fortran has been instrumental in bridging the gap between modern software development practices and traditional scientific programming. Many legacy Fortran applications, which remain critical to disciplines like fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and climate modeling, can now be integrated with modern data analysis workflows in Python. Notable Fortran libraries such as LAPACK, BLAS, and ARPACK are extensively used by widespread Python libraries like <code>SciPy</code> and <code>NumPy</code>. These Fortran libraries provide highly optimized routines for linear algebra, eigenvalue problems, and other numerical computations, which are crucial for scientific research. This hybrid approach helps preserve the value of decades of Fortran development while augmenting it with Python’s extensive ecosystem for visualization, data manipulation, and machine learning. By extending Fortran’s reach, Python allows these fields to evolve without sacrificing their foundational computational tools.</p>

<section id="other-bindings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-bindings">Other bindings</h3>
<p>Python supports a variety of other important bindings, which further demonstrate its flexibility and widespread applicability in different computing environments.</p>
<p>One such notable binding is with Java via <code>JPype</code> and <code>Jython</code>. <code>JPype</code> allows Python to call Java code directly and even use Java objects as if they were native Python objects. This interoperability is particularly useful in environments where Java is already prevalent, such as enterprise software ecosystems. <code>Jython</code>, on the other hand, is an implementation of Python in Java, allowing Python code to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and seamlessly integrate with Java libraries.</p>
<p>Another important binding is with Erlang through the <code>Pyrlang</code> library, which allows Python to interact with the Erlang virtual machine. This capability is particularly valuable in building distributed, concurrent systems, where Erlang’s strengths are utilized alongside Python’s ease of use.</p>
<p>Python also has strong bindings with Julia, especially through the <code>PyJulia</code> package. Julia, known for its speed in numerical computations, can be integrated with Python, allowing developers to take advantage of Julia’s performance while using Python’s extensive libraries for data analysis, visualization, and more. This integration makes it possible to combine the best features of both languages in scientific computing applications.</p>
<p>Another widely used binding is with Go, facilitated by <code>gopy</code>. This allows Python to call Go functions and benefit from Go’s capabilities in building fast, concurrent programs, while still leveraging Python’s higher-level abstractions and extensive package ecosystem.</p>
<p>Similarly, Python’s interoperability with Lisp is facilitated by libraries like <code>CLPython</code>, which allows Lisp programs to call Python functions and vice versa. These bindings make Python a universal tool for integrating technologies, bridging ecosystems, and creating highly versatile software solutions.</p>

<section id="python-as-a-glue-language" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="python-as-a-glue-language">Python as a glue language</h3>
<p>Python’s characterization as a “glue language” aptly captures its proficiency in binding disparate systems and libraries, often implemented in different programming languages. This attribute makes Python particularly valuable in domains such as scientific computing and data analysis, where the need to integrate legacy codebases—often written in Fortran or C—is prevalent. The ability to unify different software components, regardless of their underlying implementation languages, is a cornerstone of Python’s versatility and is a major reason for its widespread adoption in multidisciplinary fields.</p>
<p>The <code>SciPy</code> ecosystem serves as a quintessential example of Python’s role as a glue language; many of its foundational components are underpinned by Fortran libraries that are exposed to users via Python interfaces. This integration allows researchers and engineers to capitalize on the numerical efficiency of Fortran while interacting with these components through Python’s expressive and flexible syntax. In these contexts, Python functions as an intermediary, bridging the gap between highly optimized, domain-specific routines and user-friendly, accessible code, thereby positioning itself as an indispensable tool for developing sophisticated, high-performance applications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Python’s role as a glue language extends beyond simply interfacing with compiled code. It is also instrumental in orchestrating complex workflows that involve multiple tools and systems. In data science, for example, Python is often used to preprocess data, call optimized C/C++ or Fortran routines for heavy computation, and then visualize the results using libraries like <code>matplotlib</code>. This orchestration capability allows Python to serve as the connective tissue of a larger computational pipeline, integrating diverse tools into a cohesive workflow.</p>
<p>In modern software architectures, Python’s ability to serve as a glue language is also evident in its use within microservices and distributed systems. Python’s extensive standard library and the availability of numerous third-party packages make it an ideal choice for writing service interfaces, APIs, and automation scripts that interact with different parts of a distributed system. By using Python to bind together different components—whether they are services, databases, or computational modules—developers can create systems that are both modular and scalable.</p>
<p>Python’s glue capabilities are further enhanced by its compatibility with other high-level tools and platforms. For example, Python can interact seamlessly with Java through libraries like <code>Py4J</code>, enabling the integration of Python scripts within Java applications. This is particularly valuable in enterprise environments, where Java often serves as the backbone of large-scale applications, while Python is used for data analysis, machine learning, and scripting tasks. By bridging these two ecosystems, Python facilitates a hybrid development model that leverages the strengths of both languages.</p>
<p>Moreover, Python’s role as a glue language is not limited to computational libraries and services but also extends to integrating emerging technologies and paradigms. In artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, Python is the language of choice for prototyping models that leverage specialized hardware like GPUs and TPUs. Python frameworks like <code>TensorFlow</code> and <code>PyTorch</code> provide bindings to optimized C++ backends, enabling efficient execution while allowing developers to iterate quickly. Python’s flexibility and ease of integration make it possible to interface with both established software systems and cutting-edge hardware accelerators, thereby bridging traditional computing with next-generation technologies.</p>

<p>An epistemic level of interpretation refers to the way knowledge is represented, acquired, and processed within a system<sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup>. In the context of programming languages, it involves examining how a language enables programmers to model, manipulate, and reason about information and concepts. Applying this to Python, we can define an epistemic level of interpretation by exploring how Python’s features facilitate the expression of knowledge and support human cognitive processes in problem-solving<sup>5</sup>.</p>

This alignment can be understood through cognitive theories such as embodied cognition, which suggests that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body’s interactions with the world<sup>6</sup>, and distributed cognition, which emphasizes that cognitive processes extend beyond the individual to include tools and environments<sup>7</sup>. Python’s intuitive syntax and high-level abstractions allow it to effectively serve as an extension of human cognitive processes, facilitating problem-solving and reasoning. This alignment is evident in several key aspects of the language:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Expressive syntax</strong>: Python’s syntax is concise and resembles natural language or mathematical notation, allowing programmers to translate their thoughts into code with minimal friction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abstraction mechanisms</strong>: Python supports various abstraction mechanisms like functions, classes, and modules, enabling developers to encapsulate complex ideas and reuse code effectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic typing</strong>: The dynamic type system allows for flexible manipulation of data without the need for explicit type declarations, mirroring how humans often think abstractly about data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>First-class functions and higher-order programming</strong>: Functions in Python are first-class citizens, allowing for functional programming paradigms that facilitate a pure style of coding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support for multiple programming paradigms</strong>: Python’s versatility extends to its support for multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="facilitating-epistemic-practices-through-libraries">Facilitating epistemic practices through libraries</h3>
<p>Python’s extensive ecosystem of libraries supports epistemic practices by providing tools that align with domain-specific knowledge representations. This relationship can be linked to cognitive load theory, which emphasizes how domain-specific libraries reduce the cognitive burden for users by providing tailored, high-level abstractions that simplify complex tasks. For instance, libraries like Pandas and NumPy allow for data manipulation and numerical computations that are essential in scientific inquiry.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="python-and-cognitive-alignment">Python and cognitive alignment</h3>
<p>Python’s design facilitates cognitive alignment by reducing the gap between mental models and their implementation in code. This concept can be further explained through mental model theory or cognitive fit theory, both of which provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how Python’s syntax and abstractions support alignment between a programmer’s conceptual understanding and the actual code implementation. This concept can be further explained through mental model theory, which posits that individuals create internal representations of systems to understand and predict their behavior<sup>8</sup>. Python’s syntax and abstractions align well with these mental models, thereby reducing cognitive load and enhancing the ease with which programmers can translate conceptual ideas into functional code. This is achieved through:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Johnson-Laird, P. N. (1983). <em>Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference, and Consciousness</em>. Harvard University Press.</p></div></div><ul>
<li><p><strong>Readability</strong>: Code that is easy to read and understand reduces cognitive load by minimizing the mental effort required to comprehend its purpose and logic. Pythonic code emphasizes clear, straightforward constructs that align with natural language, thereby allowing developers to quickly grasp the functionality without excessive interpretation. This reduction in cognitive load is particularly important for complex projects, as it enables developers to focus more on solving problems rather than deciphering convoluted code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intuitive error handling</strong>: Python’s exception handling allows developers to manage errors in a way that reflects logical reasoning, including handling unexpected conditions gracefully. By using <code>try-except</code> blocks, developers can anticipate potential errors and implement appropriate fallback mechanisms, ensuring that the program can continue running or fail gracefully without crashing. This capability to manage unforeseen issues lowers the cognitive burden by making error management more predictable and structured, which is particularly useful in complex systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Garbage collection</strong>: Python’s garbage collection mechanism automatically handles memory management by reclaiming unused memory, thereby freeing developers from the complex task of manual memory allocation and deallocation. This feature not only reduces the risk of memory leaks and segmentation faults but also allows developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving without worrying about low-level resource management. By abstracting away these intricate details, garbage collection contributes to lowering the cognitive load required for efficient coding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modularization</strong>: Python’s modularization capabilities are crucial as they allow developers to create reusable libraries and modules with well-defined functionality. This modular approach helps in abstracting away implementation details, enabling developers to use and understand high-level components without delving into the intricacies of the underlying code. By providing a clear separation of concerns, modularization promotes cleaner, more maintainable code and reduces the mental effort required to comprehend large and complex codebases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive development</strong>: The availability of interactive shells like IPython and Jupyter notebooks supports exploratory programming and immediate feedback, which are important for knowledge acquisition and hypothesis testing.</p></li>

<p>By operating at an epistemic level, Python serves as an effective educational tool, enabling learners to focus on problem-solving strategies and conceptual understanding rather than syntactic complexities. This approach aligns with constructivist learning theory, which posits that learners build new knowledge on top of existing cognitive structures by actively engaging with content. Python’s design reduces extraneous cognitive load, as suggested by Cognitive Load Theory<sup>9</sup>, allowing learners to concentrate on essential problem-solving processes.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enhancing-epistemic-access-through-community-and-documentation">Enhancing epistemic access through community and documentation</h3>
<p>Python’s comprehensive documentation and supportive community contribute to its epistemic accessibility. Resources like the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), tutorials, and forums provide avenues for knowledge sharing and collective learning. The Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process is a key element of Python’s evolution. PEPs are design documents that describe new features or changes to Python, offering a formalized way for the community to propose, discuss, and implement language improvements. This structured process, managed by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), ensures that Python evolves in a coherent and organized manner, balancing innovation with stability. Over the years, the PEP process has brought significant changes to Python, such as the transition to Python 3 (PEP 3000) and the ongoing efforts to remove the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) (PEP 703). These changes have enhanced Python’s compatibility, performance, and usability, reflecting the community-driven approach that keeps Python aligned with the needs of its users.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Python’s unique position as an interface language lies in its ability to bridge the cognitive gap between human reasoning and machine execution. By leveraging its simplified syntax, high-level abstractions, and support for multiple programming paradigms, Python effectively reduces cognitive load and enables developers—both professional and non-professional—to focus on problem-solving rather than the intricacies of machine-level programming. Its design philosophy, epitomized in the concept of ‘Pythonic’ code, ensures that readability and maintainability are prioritized, thereby fostering cleaner, more efficient software development.</p>
<p>The parallels between Python and natural language, particularly English, make Python an accessible language for newcomers and experienced developers alike. This natural alignment facilitates an intuitive coding experience, where the translation of human thought processes into machine instructions feels seamless. The epistemic lens through which Python operates not only supports cognitive alignment but also enhances accessibility through its ecosystem of libraries, community-driven documentation, and well-structured evolution via Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs).</p>
<p>The evolution of Python, through key changes such as the transition to Python 3 and the ongoing efforts to remove the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), reflects a commitment to continuous improvement while staying true to its core principles. Python’s adaptability and capacity to serve as a glue language in various domains—ranging from artificial intelligence and data science to education—underscore its versatility and enduring relevance in the software development landscape.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Python’s role as an interface language extends beyond mere syntax; it embodies a philosophical approach to programming that prioritizes human cognitive compatibility. By reducing barriers between human thought and machine logic, Python not only facilitates efficient software development but also fosters an inclusive programming culture where knowledge representation and problem-solving are accessible to a broad audience. The language’s continued evolution ensures that it remains at the forefront of modern computing, bridging the gap between abstract human cognition and concrete machine execution in an ever-changing technological world.</p>

  <title>Controllo delle Partite IVA in Excel Tramite il Servizio VIES</title>
  <dc:creator>Antonio Montano</dc:creator>
  <link>https://antomon.github.io/posts/controllo-piva-vies-api/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduzione" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduzione">Introduzione</h2>
<p>Un cliente aveva qualche migliaia di Partite IVA europee da controllare e la sindrome del buon samaritano mi ha costretto a spolverare il VBA per poter sfruttare lo strumento client più amato nelle aziende: Excel!</p>
<p>Questa guida, pertanto, ti mostra come utilizzare un file Excel per controllare la validità delle Partite IVA tramite il servizio <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation"><strong>VIES</strong></a> (VAT Information Exchange System).</p>
<p>Il post è diviso in due parti: la prima è pensata per gli utenti che non hanno esperienza di programmazione, ma hanno un minimo di conoscenza di Excel e la seconda è per chi ha conoscenze di base in <strong>VBA</strong> e vuole modificare o personalizzare il file Excel o il codice.</p>
</section>
<section id="come-utilizzare-il-file-excel" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="come-utilizzare-il-file-excel">Come utilizzare il file Excel</h2>
<p>Questa sezione è per chi vuole semplicemente utilizzare il foglio Excel già predisposto per controllare le Partite IVA senza la necessità di modificare il codice.</p>
<section id="esecuzione-del-controllo" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="esecuzione-del-controllo">Esecuzione del controllo</h3>
<p>Passaggi per eseguire il controllo delle Partite IVA:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Apri il file Excel</strong>: Assicurati di scaricare e aprire il file <a href="CONTROLLO-PARTITE-IVA-CON-VIES.xlsm">Excel</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inserisci i dati delle Partite IVA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vai al foglio specificato nella cella <strong>B3</strong> del foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In questo foglio troverai le seguenti colonne:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonna A (CODICE PAESE)</strong>: Inserisci il codice del paese (es. IT per Italia, FR per Francia, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Colonna B (P.IVA)</strong>: Inserisci il numero di Partita IVA da controllare.</li>
<li><strong>Colonna C (ESITO CONTROLLO CON VIES)</strong>: I risultati del controllo effettuato tramite il servizio VIES appariranno qui.</li>
<li><strong>Colonna D (ESITO CONTROLLO SINTATTICO (NON LIMITANTE))</strong>: Qui verrà riportato il risultato del controllo sintattico della Partita IVA, ovvero se il formato è valido o meno, basato su una regex (non blocca l’esecuzione del controllo VIES).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Clicca sul bottone per eseguire il controllo</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nel foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>, troverai un bottone a forma di <strong>triangolo nero</strong>, simile al tasto “Play” di un lettore multimediale.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clicca sul bottone</strong> per avviare il controllo delle Partite IVA.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpreta i risultati</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Una volta avviato il controllo, i risultati verranno visualizzati:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Colonna C</strong>: Mostra il risultato del controllo tramite il servizio VIES.</li>
<li><strong>Colonna D</strong>: Mostra se il formato della Partita IVA è valido o meno (controllo sintattico). Se il controllo sintattico è positivo, apparirà “Valida”, se è negativo apparirà “Non valida”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Alla fine del processo, comparirà una <strong>finestra di riepilogo</strong> che mostra il numero totale di Partite IVA controllate, quante sono risultate valide o non valide, gli errori riscontrati, e le Partite IVA vuote.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Al termine dell’esecuzione, il sistema visualizzerà una finestra di dialogo che mostrerà il seguente riepilogo:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Numero di P.IVA controllate</strong>: Numero totale di Partite IVA processate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Valide in VIES</strong>: Partite IVA che risultano valide dopo il controllo con il servizio VIES.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non valide in VIES</strong>: Partite IVA che risultano non valide nel servizio VIES (potrebbero non essere registrate o essere errate).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Errori</strong>: Numero di errori riscontrati durante il controllo (ad esempio, problemi con il servizio VIES o con i dati).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vuote</strong>: Numero di righe in cui la Partita IVA non era presente o la cella era vuota.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficienza</strong>: Velocità di controllo espressa in Partite IVA per minuto.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personalizzare-e-modificare-il-codice">Personalizzare e modificare il codice</h2>
<p>Questa sezione è pensata per chi ha già una conoscenza di base di <strong>VBA</strong> e desidera personalizzare o modificare il codice VBA per adattarlo alle proprie necessità.</p>
<section id="struttura-del-codice" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="struttura-del-codice">Struttura del Codice</h3>
<p>Il codice VBA esegue principalmente due controlli:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Validazione del formato della Partita IVA</strong>: Utilizza un’espressione regolare (regex) per verificare che il formato della Partita IVA sia conforme alle regole del paese.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Controllo tramite VIES</strong>: Invia una richiesta al servizio VIES per verificare se la Partita IVA è valida.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="come-modificare-il-codice-vba" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="come-modificare-il-codice-vba">Come modificare il codice VBA</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Aprire l’editor VBA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Premi <code>ALT + F11</code> per aprire l’editor VBA.</p></li>
<li><p>Nel pannello a sinistra, troverai un modulo chiamato <strong>Modulo1</strong> o simile. Qui è contenuto tutto il codice.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Controllo sintattico</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Il controllo sintattico del formato della Partita IVA non blocca il controllo tramite VIES. Anche se il controllo fallisce (ad esempio, se il formato è errato), la richiesta al servizio VIES verrà comunque effettuata. Il risultato del controllo sintattico viene inserito nella <strong>Colonna D (ESITO CONTROLLO SINTATTICO (NON LIMITANTE))</strong>. Se il formato è valido, apparirà “Valida”, altrimenti “Non valida”.</p>
</section>
<section id="modifica" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modifica">Modifica</h3>
<p>Se desideri modificare o aggiungere una regex per un nuovo paese, segui questi passaggi:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Vai nel foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inserisci il <strong>codice del paese</strong> nella colonna A (es. “PT” per il Portogallo).</p></li>
<li><p>Inserisci il pattern <strong>regex</strong> corretto nella colonna B per validare il formato delle Partite IVA del paese specifico (ad esempio, per il Portogallo, potrebbe essere <code>^\d{9}$</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Salva e chiudi.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Il codice VBA utilizzerà automaticamente la regex inserita per validare il formato delle Partite IVA per quel paese.</p>
<p>Altre configurazioni:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Numero massimo di righe da controllare</strong>: Se nella cella <strong>B1</strong> del foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong> non viene inserito un valore, la macro controllerà tutte le righe con Partite IVA fino alla prima riga vuota. Se viene inserito un numero, controllerà solo quel numero di righe.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Codice paese predefinito</strong>: Se una Partita IVA non ha un codice paese associato (colonna A vuota), verrà usato il codice predefinito specificato nella cella <strong>B2</strong> del foglio <strong>CONFIGURAZIONE</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Questa guida ti permette di utilizzare un file Excel per controllare le Partite IVA europee tramite il servizio VIES. Se sei un utente che non ha familiarità con la programmazione, puoi facilmente utilizzare il file cliccando semplicemente su un bottone. Se hai invece conoscenze di VBA, puoi personalizzare il codice o modificare il file per adattarlo meglio alle tue esigenze specifiche, come l’aggiunta di nuovi paesi o la modifica dei messaggi restituiti.</p>
<p>In questo modo, puoi automatizzare il controllo delle Partite IVA e risparmiare tempo nella gestione dei dati aziendali.</p>
