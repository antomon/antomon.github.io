## What I do

I help enterprises **transform how they operate, decide, and create value** by redesigning the technological backbone that supports their business.

Digital transformation is often misunderstood as a software rollout, a cloud migration, or an “AI initiative”. In practice, it is none of these in isolation.

Real transformation happens when:

- technology enables *better decisions*,
- processes become *adaptive rather than rigid*,
- roles and responsibilities are *explicit and executable*,
- and customers experience *measurable value*, not internal optimization theater.

My work sits exactly at this intersection: **business value, operating model, and technology execution**.

### My perspective on digital transformation

> Digital transformation is not a destination. It is a **continuous capability**.

Enterprises fail not because they lack tools, but because they lack:

- a coherent roadmap connecting business goals to systems,
- accountability across functions,
- and the ability to translate intent into execution artifacts.

I approach transformation as a **systemic redesign** of how an enterprise senses, decides, and acts.

This means working simultaneously on:

- **value creation logic** (why we do things),
- **processes and governance** (how decisions flow),
- **technology and data** (what executes decisions),
- **roles and responsibilities** (who owns outcomes).

Technology is a means, not the goal, but without technical depth, strategy remains abstract.

### What problems I typically solve

I am usually engaged when organizations face one or more of these situations:

- Digital initiatives exist, but **results are fragmented or disappointing**
- ERP, CRM, MES, and analytics systems are present, yet **decisions are still manual and slow**
- Business units operate in silos, each optimizing locally
- Roadmaps exist, but **execution drifts** or vendors drive the agenda
- Requirements are produced, but **no one feels accountable for outcomes**
- IT is overloaded, while business feels “not understood”

These are not technology problems. They are **coordination and translation problems**.

### From customer value to operating reality

Every engagement starts from a simple but often neglected question: **what concrete value must the customer experience?**

From there, I work backward:

1. What capabilities must the enterprise have to deliver that value?
2. Which processes support those capabilities?
3. Which decisions must be taken, and by whom?
4. Which systems must sense, decide, and act?
5. What data and signals are required?

This avoids the classic trap of optimizing internal efficiency while eroding external relevance.

### Roadmaps that can actually be executed

I design **roadmaps that survive contact with reality**.

Not high-level vision decks, but multi-layer roadmaps that connect:

- strategic objectives,
- process evolution,
- system changes,
- organizational impacts,
- and delivery constraints.

A roadmap is useful only if it can answer, at any point in time:

- what changes next,
- why it matters,
- who is accountable,
- and how success will be measured.

This includes explicit **dependency management**, phasing, and risk trade-offs, not just timelines.

### Execution: where most transformations fail

Strategy without execution is storytelling. Execution without strategy is chaos.

I actively support execution by working on concrete artifacts such as:

- bids and vendor evaluations,
- work breakdown structures (WBS),
- delivery governance models,
- system and integration architectures,
- technology stack definitions,
- and rollout strategies across entities or geographies.

I am comfortable operating inside delivery constraints: budgets, contracts, regulatory requirements, legacy systems, and organizational politics.

Transformation does not happen in ideal conditions. It happens inside existing enterprises.

### Process, software, and roles: designed together

One of the most common failure modes is designing:

- processes without systems,
- systems without roles,
- or roles without decision rights.

I explicitly design **processes, software, and organizational roles as a single system**.

This includes:

- process models that reflect how work actually flows,
- clear ownership of data and decisions,
- role definitions linked to system responsibilities,
- and governance mechanisms that prevent ambiguity.

The goal is not documentation, but **operability**.

### Technology with depth, not buzzwords

I bring strong technical depth, but I avoid technology for its own sake.

I work comfortably with complex enterprise landscapes, including:

- ERP and core transactional systems,
- CRM and customer-facing platforms,
- integration layers and APIs,
- data platforms and analytics,
- and emerging AI-enabled decision systems.

This allows me to challenge vendors, translate between business and IT, and prevent architectural shortcuts that create long-term debt.

Technology choices are always evaluated against **business optionality**, not trends.

### How I typically engage

I work as a **freelance consultant**, often in roles such as:

- interim CIO / CTO,
- digital transformation lead,
- enterprise or solution architect,
- or senior advisor to executives and program leaders.

Engagements may include:

- assessment and diagnostic phases,
- roadmap and operating model design,
- execution oversight,
- or hands-on delivery leadership.

I integrate with existing teams rather than replacing them, strengthening internal capability instead of creating dependency.

### What you should expect from working with me

Clients typically value that I:

- speak both business and technology fluently,
- make implicit assumptions explicit,
- surface trade-offs early,
- and focus relentlessly on outcomes.

I am not a “framework seller” and not a body-for-hire.

I work to **reduce complexity**, increase clarity, and leave the organization stronger than I found it.

### Digital transformation, done seriously

Digital transformation is hard because it forces organizations to confront how they actually work, not how they describe themselves.

Handled correctly, it creates:

- faster and better decisions,
- resilient operations,
- scalable growth,
- and real customer value.

Handled poorly, it creates expensive systems and frustrated people.

My role is to make sure it is handled seriously.

## Core knowledge areas and domains of expertise

My work spans multiple domains, but always with the same objective: **make complex enterprises operable, secure, and evolvable**.

What follows is not a list of tools, but the **knowledge areas I actively integrate** when designing and executing digital transformation initiatives.

### Enterprise architecture as a practical discipline

I practice **enterprise architecture (EA) as an operational tool**, not as an abstract documentation exercise.

Architecture, when done correctly, creates alignment between:

- business strategy,
- operating model,
- processes and decision rights,
- information systems,
- and technology platforms.

I work across all classical EA layers:

- **Business architecture**: capabilities, value streams, organizational responsibilities.
- **Process architecture**: end-to-end flows, cross-functional dependencies, governance points.
- **Application architecture**: system boundaries, responsibilities, integration patterns.
- **Data architecture**: ownership, master data, flows, lifecycle.
- **Technology architecture**: infrastructure, networks, security zones, platforms.

I routinely use and adapt established frameworks (such as TOGAF, ArchiMate, capability-based planning), but I treat them as **means**, not goals. The output must support decisions, investments, and execution, otherwise it is noise.

Over time, I have articulated and refined it through a series of **public articles and essays** dedicated to enterprise architecture, operating models, and digital transformation.

These writings explore topics such as:

- enterprise architecture as a coordination mechanism rather than a documentation exercise,
- capability-based thinking versus system-centric design,
- the limits of static target architectures in dynamic environments,
- and the role of architecture in continuous transformation rather than one-off programs.

The articles are not theoretical abstractions detached from reality. They are grounded in real transformation programs, complex enterprise landscapes, and regulated industries.

They reflect the same principles I apply in client work: clarity over jargon, systems thinking over silos, and execution over diagrams.

A selection of these contributions is publicly available [here](../../#category=enterprise%20architecture).

This body of work allows clients and partners to understand **how I think**, not just what I deliver, and provides a shared conceptual language when working together on complex transformation initiatives.

### Cybersecurity across IT and OT environments

Cybersecurity is not a vertical concern. It is a **structural property of the enterprise**.

I design and assess cybersecurity architectures across:

- traditional IT environments (enterprise systems, cloud platforms, endpoints),
- and **OT / industrial environments** (plants, machinery, SCADA, PLCs, field devices).

This includes deep familiarity with:

- **IEC 62443** for industrial automation and control systems,
- **ISO/IEC 27001** and related standards for IT security,
- **NIST** and defense-in-depth models,
- and secure network segmentation, identity, logging, and monitoring patterns.

I have **extensive experience in the energy sector**, including power generation, energy storage, grid-connected assets, and critical infrastructure, where cybersecurity is inseparable from safety and availability.

On the regulatory side, I work with full awareness of the European landscape, including:

- **NIS2** (risk management, governance, incident response),
- **Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)** implications on products and supply chains,
- sector-specific obligations for critical and essential entities.

Cybersecurity is treated not as a compliance checkbox, but as a **design constraint** that shapes architectures, processes, contracts, and vendor relationships.

### End-to-end B2B and B2C processes

I work across **both B2B and B2C operating models**, with a focus on complex, real-world processes rather than simplified textbook flows.

Typical domains include:

- marketing and demand generation,
- sales and pre-sales,
- pricing, contracting, and discount models,
- order management and fulfillment,
- after-sales, service, and lifecycle management.

I am particularly experienced in **B2B environments** where:

- sales cycles are long and non-linear,
- products are configurable or engineered,
- pricing and margins depend on multiple variables,
- and multiple legal entities or channels are involved.

At the same time, I understand **B2C dynamics**, where scale, automation, customer experience, and responsiveness dominate.

The key is not the channel, but the **coherence between promise and execution**.

### Vertical experience

Over time, I have worked across multiple industries, allowing me to recognize recurring patterns and avoid reinvention:

- manufacturing (discrete and process),
- energy and utilities,
- industrial equipment and engineered products,
- services and hybrid product-service models,
- finance-related domains where governance and controls are critical.

This cross-vertical exposure allows me to transfer **proven operating models** while respecting sector-specific constraints, regulations, and economics.

### ERP as the backbone of execution

I consider ERP systems not as administrative tools, but as **the execution engine of the enterprise**.

I have deep hands-on experience with ERP platforms, particularly in manufacturing and multi-entity environments, covering areas such as:

- **Finance**: general ledger, controlling, budgeting, reporting, compliance.
- **Procurement and sourcing**: vendor management, purchasing, contracts, approvals.
- **Supply chain**: planning, inventory, logistics, intercompany flows.
- **Manufacturing**: BOMs, routings, production planning, execution, costing.
- **Sales and distribution**: pricing, discounts, order management, invoicing.
- **Product management**: product masters, variants, lifecycle, governance.
- **Project and service modules**, where relevant.

I am especially attentive to:

- cross-legal-entity scenarios,
- data governance and master data consistency,
- integration with CRM, MES, and external systems,
- and the long-term evolvability of the solution.

ERP implementations fail when treated as IT projects.  
They succeed when treated as **enterprise redesign initiatives**.

### Integration, data, and emerging intelligence

Modern enterprises are ecosystems, not monoliths.

I routinely design and govern:

- integration architectures (APIs, event-driven patterns),
- data platforms for reporting and analytics,
- and the foundations for advanced decision support and AI-enabled capabilities.

This includes ensuring that:

- data has clear ownership,
- signals are reliable and timely,
- and automated decisions remain auditable and controllable.

Emerging technologies are evaluated pragmatically:  
only when they create **real optionality** for the business.

### One integrated approach

What ties all these knowledge areas together is not breadth for its own sake, but **integration**.

Digital transformation fails when domains are treated separately. It succeeds when architecture, security, processes, systems, and people are designed as **one coherent system**.

That is the work I do.
