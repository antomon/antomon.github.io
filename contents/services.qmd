I help enterprises transform how they operate, decide, and create value by aligning strategy, processes, and technology into one coherent system.

Digital transformation is often reduced to tools, platforms, or isolated initiatives. In practice, it succeeds only when technology enables better decisions, organizations become easier to run, and customers experience real value. My work sits where intent meets execution.

I translate business ambition into clear capabilities, processes, roles, and systems that work together.
Enterprise architecture is used as a practical discipline to create alignment, not documentation.

I design transformations that hold under real constraints: complex IT and OT environments, cybersecurity, and European regulations such as NIS2 and the Cyber Resilience Act.
Security and compliance are embedded by design, not added later.

I work hands-on with roadmaps, vendors, delivery structures, and system architectures to ensure change actually happens, across functions, legal entities, and geographies.

I am typically engaged when organizations have invested heavily in systems, ERP, CRM, analytics, yet still struggle with slow decisions, fragmented execution, and unclear accountability. These are rarely technology problems. They are coordination problems.

I work from customer value backward, designing processes, systems, and responsibilities as one integrated whole, and supporting execution all the way through.

Handled well, digital transformation creates faster decisions, resilient operations, and sustainable growth.
Handled poorly, it creates expensive systems and frustrated people.

My role is to make sure it is handled seriously. [Explore here](digital-transformation/index.qmd)
