## About me

My preferred headline is “Digital Transformer” because I enjoy transforming enterprises with new or improved business processes largely relying on cutting-edge technologies.

I advise C-level managers to pursue all the opportunities arising from cloud computing, machine learning, and blockchain (to name a few), for increased value creation, agility, scalability, and resilience. More importantly, I have a consistent track record of designs and implementations of innovative and secure software platforms, able to provide long-lasting value added.

My journey began in 1996 as a software developer and now I have almost thirty years of experience as a manager of organizational entities, programs, and projects, employed by multinational companies, small pioneering start-ups, and innovative firms, mainly in the finance and energy business sectors.

I managed projects with millions of Euros budget in deadline-driven contexts from inception to delivery, through assorted teams with tens of members and contractors, to build a wide range of systems, processes, and services on time and within budget. As a project manager, my mantra is composed of 5 principles: build vision, nurture teamwork, promote performance, cultivate learning, and ensure results, all daily. As a team lead, I adapt the coaching style to each member and context to accelerate the incorporation of those principles. Also, having hands-on experience in many technologies allows me to be resolutive and supportive in stressful conditions.

I have a university degree in Electronic Engineering and completed many courses in project management, change management, and diverse technologies to stay relevant (see below for last completed courses). Moreover, past academic research was published in outstanding international journals.

Specialties:

-   Organizational unit management

-   Innovation through cutting-edge technologies and technology transfer

-   Project and program management by international standards

-   Systems and processes design, reengineering, and integration

-   Systems and business processes outsourcing contract definition and management

-   Budget and risk assessment for new ventures

-   Digital transformation planning and implementation

-   Hands-on knowledge of the most common protocols, architectures, and systems

-   Informed understanding of well-established, innovative, exponential technologies.
