## Introduction

Imagine youâ€™re building a healthcare app that needs to analyze patient data stored in the cloud. Since the data is sensitive, you encrypt it before sending it. However, every time you need to analyze the data, you have to decrypt it, which means the data is exposed and creates a security risk.

This is the main problem with traditional encryption systems like RSA and AES. They protect data while it's stored or sent, but as soon as you need to use the data, you have to decrypt it. Itâ€™s like keeping money in a safe but needing to take it out every time you want to count it. This fundamental limitation makes it challenging to keep sensitive information secure throughout its lifecycle, especially as more applications rely on cloud computing, where the need for remote processing is common.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) aims to solve this problem by allowing data to remain encrypted even while it's being processed. It promises to make the cloud much safer for storing and analyzing data, which could have far-reaching impacts on healthcare, finance, and many other fields. Imagine being able to calculate the average income of a group of people without ever knowing how much any individual earns, that's the promise of HE.

### The challenge with data security

Even when data is encrypted and stored in the cloud, there are still some risks:

1. Metadata exposure: Even if the data is encrypted, cloud providers can still see some information:

   - When the data is accessed.
   - How much data is being processed.
   - Patterns of usage that could reveal some details.

   Metadata may not contain the actual content of the data, but it can still provide insights that compromise privacy. For instance, frequent access to a medical record could imply a serious health condition, even if the actual diagnosis remains encrypted.

2. Trust issues: Cloud providers or intermediaries who have access to encryption keys could:

   - Access decrypted data when it's being processed.
   - Keep metadata even after the service ends.
   - Create privacy risks by storing information about data access, which could help them infer details even if the data itself is never fully decrypted

   These issues highlight the importance of removing the need to trust third parties. HE can help solve this problem by ensuring that data remains encrypted, even when it's being analyzed.

### Computing on encrypted data

Letâ€™s say Alice has some data $m$, and Bob has a function $f$. Alice wants to know the answer to $f(m)$:

- Traditional approach: Alice has to share $m$ with Bob.

In traditional encryption, encrypted data canâ€™t be processed in any useful way. HE is different, because it keeps the relationships between numbers, even when theyâ€™re encrypted. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

- Letâ€™s say you have two numbers, $a$ and $b$.

- You encrypt them to get $Enc(a)$ and $Enc(b)$.

- With HE, you can add $Enc(a)$ and $Enc(b)$ and get an encrypted result that, when decrypted, gives you $a + b$.

This means you can perform calculations on encrypted data without having to decrypt it first. The ability to compute on encrypted data without decryption is what makes HE so revolutionary. In essence, it allows data to stay secure throughout its entire lifecycle, from collection to storage to processing.

HE works by using complex mathematical operations that preserve the structure of the data even when it's encrypted. The mathematics behind this is quite advanced, involving abstract algebra and number theory. These mathematical techniques ensure that operations such as addition and multiplication can be performed on the encrypted data in a way that yields correct results when decrypted.

### Semantic security and controlled malleability

HE is possible thanks to two key cryptographic concepts: **semantic security** and **controlled malleability**. While these might sound technical, theyâ€™re not too hard to understand when broken down.  

First, letâ€™s talk about semantic security. This property ensures that encrypted data reveals absolutely nothing about the original data. For example, even if you encrypt the same message twice, the results will look completely different every time, like writing a note and hiding it in different locked boxes that look unique each time. This randomness makes it impossible for someone to guess the original message just by looking at the encrypted result. Semantic security is a cornerstone of most modern encryption schemes, such as AES for secure data storage and RSA for transmitting confidential messages over the internet. In these systems, semantic security ensures that an attacker cannot deduce the plaintext, even if they intercept encrypted messages.

Now, letâ€™s look at controlled malleability. Normally, encryption schemes are designed to prevent any modification of encrypted data. For example, in secure messaging or financial transactions, tampering with ciphertexts could lead to corruption or malicious alterations. This is why many encryption schemes aim to be non-malleable, ensuring ciphertexts cannot be manipulated in any meaningful way. However, some cryptographic protocols intentionally use a controlled form of malleability. For instance:

- RSA encryption supports a basic level of malleability, enabling certain transformations (e.g., multiplying ciphertexts) that correspond to transformations on the plaintext. This is leveraged in digital signatures and secure voting systems.

- Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) uses malleable properties to allow multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs without revealing them to each other.

HE takes controlled malleability a step further by enabling a rich set of mathematical operations, such as additions and multiplications, to be performed directly on encrypted data. This means that encrypted data can be actively processed, opening up new possibilities for secure computation without exposing sensitive information.

By combining semantic security with controlled malleability, HE represents a powerful new paradigm in cryptography. While semantic security ensures that the original data remains completely hidden, controlled malleability allows computations on that hidden data in a secure and predictable way. Together, these concepts extend the boundaries of what encryption can achieve, enabling privacy-preserving technologies that go far beyond the limitations of traditional cryptographic schemes.

### Types of HE

HE encompasses various schemes, each with distinct capabilities, applications, and a shared mathematical heritage that connects their evolution. These different types of HE have progressively built on one another, with each advancement adding new capabilities while maintaining foundational principles rooted in number theory and algebra.

1. **Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE):**

   - PHE supports a single type of operationâ€”either addition or multiplicationâ€”on encrypted data, which offers high efficiency due to its limited operational scope.

   - Applications: Ideal for scenarios requiring only one type of computation. For instance, PHE is utilized in secure voting systems, where votes are encrypted and then aggregated (added) without decryption, ensuring voter privacy and data integrity.

   - Historical context: The concept of PHE dates back to 1978 with the introduction of the RSA algorithm[^RSA-homomorphic-encryption-developers], which supports multiplicative homomorphism. Subsequent schemes, such as the Paillier cryptosystem introduced in 1999, provided additive homomorphism, allowing for the addition of encrypted values. These early approaches laid the mathematical foundation for later, more complex forms of HE. The development of RSA was also a part of broader cryptographic breakthroughs in public-key cryptography, which fundamentally changed secure communication by allowing encryption without pre-shared keys.

[^RSA-homomorphic-encryption-developers]: Rivest, R. L., Shamir, A., & Adleman, L. (1978). **A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems**. *Communications of the ACM, 21*(2), 120â€“126. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/359340.359342)

2. **Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE):**

   - SWHE enables both addition and multiplication operations but only up to a certain depth or number of operations. It balances between operational flexibility and computational efficiency, making it suitable for applications with limited computational requirements.

   - Applications: SWHE is applied in secure data aggregation, where a limited number of operations are performed on encrypted data to compute aggregate statistics without exposing individual data points.

   - Historical context: SWHE schemes emerged as researchers sought to extend the capabilities of PHE. By building on the foundational mathematics of PHE, these schemes introduced the ability to perform both additive and multiplicative operations, though with certain limitations. This progression marked an important step towards achieving fully HE. The development of SWHE was influenced by lattice-based cryptography, which also played a crucial role in providing security against quantum computing attacks, linking SWHE to advances in post-quantum cryptography.

3. **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):**

   - FHE allows an unlimited number of both addition and multiplication operations on encrypted data. While computationally intensive, FHE provides the most comprehensive functionality, enabling complex computations on encrypted datasets.

   - Applications: FHE is particularly valuable in privacy-preserving data processing, such as performing machine learning algorithms on encrypted medical records, allowing for data analysis without compromising patient confidentiality.

   - Historical context: The concept of FHE was first realized by Craig Gentry in 2009[^Gentry09-homomorphic-encryption-developers], marking a significant advancement in cryptography. Gentry's construction built upon the principles and challenges addressed by PHE and SWHE, demonstrating that it was possible to perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data without decryption. This breakthrough opened new avenues for secure data processing, rooted in the same mathematical lineage that began with PHE. Gentry's work was heavily influenced by the concept of ideal lattices and the use of bootstrapping, which allowed for refreshing encrypted data, a concept that is closely related to error correction techniques used in coding theory. FHE also contributed to advancements in multi-party computation and secure function evaluation, highlighting its relationship with other cryptographic fields focused on secure collaborative computing.

[^Gentry09-homomorphic-encryption-developers]: Gentry, C. (2009). **Fully homomorphic encryption using ideal lattices**. *Proceedings of the 41st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing*, 169â€“178. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/1536414.1536440)

### How HE enhances private computing

HE can be combined with other privacy techniques to keep data secure while still being able to use it. These techniques are independent but can work well together with HE to achieve privacy goals:

- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: DP is a method that ensures individual data points in a dataset canâ€™t be identified, even if the results are analyzed multiple times. By adding noise to the output, DP protects people's privacy while still allowing useful insights to be gained from the data. HE can be combined with DP to keep data encrypted during analysis, while DP adds another layer of privacy. For example, a healthcare company could use HE to compute encrypted patient data and add differential privacy to ensure that the output does not compromise individual identities.

- **Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)**: SMC allows several parties to jointly compute a result from their inputs without revealing those inputs to each other. HE is often used in SMC to make sure the data stays encrypted throughout the computation. This way, everyone can contribute without giving up their private data. For example, multiple banks could jointly analyze data to detect fraud patterns without sharing individual customer information.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: ZKPs are a way to prove that a statement is true without revealing any other information beyond the fact that the statement is true. ZKPs can be combined with HE to verify computations on encrypted data without revealing any sensitive information. This is particularly useful in scenarios like blockchain, where privacy and verification are both important. For instance, ZKPs could allow someone to prove they have enough funds for a transaction without revealing their exact account balance.

### Applications of HE

#### Public cloud services

Imagine a giant digital library that many people shareâ€”this is essentially what a public cloud service is. Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Azure, or any Software as a Service (SaaS) application, such as email platforms, social networks, or collaboration tools, are examples where many users store and process their data in the same place. It's like having your personal locker in a public gymâ€”while you have your private space, you're still using a shared facility. The more "layers" or services your data interacts with, the greater the privacy risks become, as each layer can potentially expose your data to further vulnerabilities.

The challenge with public clouds is keeping your information private while still being able to use all the helpful features they offer. Think about it like this: you want to ask someone to count your money, but you don't want them to see how much you have. That's where HE comes in: it lets the cloud service work with your data without actually seeing what's in it.

Public cloud services are used for various purposes, including data storage, file sharing, and running applications remotely. The privacy challenge in public cloud services is significant, as many users want the benefits of powerful processing without sacrificing the confidentiality of their data. HE offers a groundbreaking solution, allowing computations to be performed while the data remains encrypted. This means users can get useful insights and results from their data without exposing it to the cloud provider or any unauthorized third party.

HE enables users to make the most of public cloud services without giving up their privacy. For example, organizations can store and process customer information, health records, and financial data without ever exposing sensitive information. This capability makes public cloud services more secure and suitable for a wide range of applications involving confidential data. Additionally, HE can help governments, businesses, and individuals alike to harness the full potential of cloud-based services without the fear of privacy breaches.

Moreover, HE provides a way for SaaS applications like email platforms and social networks to perform useful functions on user data while maintaining privacy. For instance, an email service could filter spam emails or provide automated categorization features without actually accessing the content of your emails. Similarly, a social network could analyze user preferences to deliver targeted content or enhance user experience, all while keeping personal data fully encrypted.

When using SaaS applications, data often passes through multiple "layers" of services, each adding to the potential privacy risks. These layers could involve data storage, processing, and analysis, all of which need to be handled with the utmost care. HE mitigates these risks by ensuring that data is encrypted throughout its entire journeyâ€”from storage to computation. This makes public cloud services and SaaS platforms much safer environments for processing sensitive information, as the data remains encrypted at every stage.

Real-world examples:

- Navigation apps: Helps you find your way without revealing where you are. Imagine telling someone, "I'm somewhere in New York" and getting directions without revealing your exact street corner. The privacy benefit is that your location stays secret while still getting accurate directions. HE allows navigation services to process your location data while keeping the exact coordinates hidden, ensuring your privacy while still providing efficient route guidance. This is especially important for users who are concerned about sharing their real-time location with third parties.

- Health monitoring Devices: Your smartwatch or fitness tracker can process your health data securely. It's like having a doctor analyze your health charts while they're in a sealed envelope. You get health insights while keeping your personal metrics private. Imagine that a health service aggregates data from thousands of users' fitness trackers to find patterns in sleep quality. HE allows this analysis while keeping every user's specific sleep data private, so the service can improve recommendations without compromising privacy. This means that even if the cloud service processes millions of health records, individual users' data remains secure and confidential.

- Personal finance: Gets insights from your data without exposing the details. Similar to having someone tell you if your spending is normal for your age group without seeing your actual purchases. You learn from your data while keeping it confidential. A budgeting app could use HE to compare a user's spending habits against aggregate data to provide personalized recommendations, all while keeping individual transactions encrypted and secure. For instance, the app could analyze spending trends, identify areas for improvement, and suggest budgeting strategiesâ€”all without ever accessing your raw financial data in a readable form.

- Email filtering: Modern email services often use filters to identify spam, categorize messages, and even detect potential phishing attacks. With HE, these services can perform all of these operations without having to read the content of your emails. This ensures that your private messages remain confidential while still benefiting from advanced filtering and organizational features. Imagine an email provider categorizing your emails into folders such as Promotions, Social, and Primaryâ€”all without actually knowing what the emails say.

- Social networks: Social media platforms often use algorithms to suggest content based on user behavior. With HE, these platforms can analyze user interactions, such as likes, comments, and shares, to provide tailored content recommendations, all while keeping user behavior encrypted. For example, if a social network wants to recommend friends or content, it can do so based on encrypted data, ensuring that your activity and preferences are kept private.

- Collaboration tools: SaaS collaboration tools like document editors or project management software can use HE to provide enhanced features while keeping user data private. Imagine multiple users collaborating on a shared document, HE can ensure that the document remains encrypted while allowing authorized users to make edits and comments. This is crucial for businesses that need to ensure confidentiality while leveraging the benefits of cloud-based collaboration.

HE represents a transformative approach to data privacy, particularly in the context of public cloud services and SaaS applications. However, as the usage of digital services continues to expand, the potential for data misuse also grows, posing significant risks to both individuals and companies. Data can be weaponized for malicious purposes, from targeted disinformation to financial exploitation, and traditional privacy measures, such as DP, may not be sufficient to fully protect sensitive information in these evolving digital landscapes. DP, while effective at masking individual contributions in datasets, often relies on the careful calibration of privacy budgets and noise, which can degrade utility or be insufficient against sophisticated attacks like reconstruction or linkage attacks, where adversaries can leverage external datasets to infer private information. HE, on the other hand, offers a promising solution by enabling computation on encrypted data without ever exposing it, providing a stronger safeguard against these emerging threats.

#### Private cloud computing

Private cloud computing provides organizations with greater control over their data and infrastructure compared to public cloud environments. This model is particularly suitable for handling sensitive information but requires a sophisticated, defense-in-depth approach to maintain data privacy and security throughout its lifecycle.

Private clouds are often employed by organizations that need to comply with stringent regulatory requirements, such as those related to healthcare, finance, or government operations. These regulations, including standards like HIPAA, GDPR, NIS2, and PCI DSS, mandate strict data protection protocols and require demonstrable security controls and audit trails.

Despite the advantages of private clouds, they remain susceptible to various threats across different layers of the technology stack. Infrastructure layer threats include software vulnerabilities in virtualization platforms, hypervisors, or orchestration tools, which can lead to risks such as privilege escalation or remote code execution (RCE). Hardware vulnerabilities, such as side-channel attacks exploiting cache timing, power analysis, or electromagnetic emanations, also pose significant risks. Physical security concerns, such as cold boot attacks and DMA attacks, along with supply chain vulnerabilities in hardware components or firmware, further complicate the security landscape.

Network layer threats include attacks such as ARP poisoning, VLAN hopping, and compromises of software-defined networking (SDN) controllers. Weaknesses in virtual network functions (VNFs) and east-west traffic attacks between workloads within the cloud are also notable vulnerabilities.

Application layer threats involve issues like API security vulnerabilities, container escape risks that allow attackers to move from containers to host systems, weaknesses in securing microservice interactions, and data leakage through application logic flaws.

Human and operational threats are also significant. Configuration drift and misconfigurations can lead to gradual deviation from secure states, while inadequate privilege management and insider threats (both malicious and unintentional) can compromise security. Operational security failures, such as lapses in maintaining secure practices, are also critical factors that must be addressed.

To mitigate these risks, organizations need a comprehensive, multi-layered security strategy that implements defense-in-depth through multiple complementary technologies. HE serves as one critical component within this broader security architecture, particularly for protecting data confidentiality during processing. Various cryptographic and security measures work together as follows:

- In the foundational security layer, hardware security modules (HSMs) are used for key management, providing secure storage and handling of cryptographic keys which are crucial for HE operations. Trusted platform modules (TPMs) ensure boot integrity, establishing a trusted baseline for secure operations, which is essential for protecting the integrity of encrypted data processed using HE. Secure boot and measured boot processes protect the system from boot-level attacks, creating a secure foundation for any HE-related operations. Physical security controls and monitoring provide physical safeguards for cloud hardware, preventing physical attacks that could compromise the hardware used to perform HE computations.

- In the network security layer, microsegmentation with zero-trust principles limits lateral movement within the network, ensuring that even if an attacker gains access, they cannot reach the nodes performing HE computations. Virtual network encryption ensures data confidentiality across virtual networks, which complements HE by protecting data during transit, even before or after HE-based processing. Network access control with 802.1x enforces authentication for devices on the network, preventing unauthorized devices from accessing data that may be encrypted using HE. SDN security, involving the separation of control and data planes, helps mitigate vulnerabilities within SDN environments, providing a secure pathway for the data to be processed using HE without risking exposure.

- For data in transit, Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy protects data from interception, while IPsec provides network-level encryption, ensuring that data remains secure during transmission before and after HE operations. For data at rest, AES-256 encryption with secure key management protects stored data from unauthorized access, complementing HE by providing strong encryption when data is not actively being processed. Format-preserving encryption is used for structured data, allowing for HE-based operations to occur without altering the structure of sensitive datasets, which is particularly useful for preserving data integrity while performing encrypted computations.

- For data in use, HE is combined with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)[^McKeen13-homomorphic-encryption-developers] for enhanced data protection during processing. TEEs provide a secure, isolated hardware environment for executing sensitive operations, protecting against unauthorized access by ensuring that data and computations are shielded from other processes on the system. HE further enhances this by keeping the data encrypted even within the TEE, ensuring that even if the secure environment is compromised, the data remains confidential.

- SMC is also employed for collaborative computations without revealing individual inputs. Advanced integrations include using HE with Intel SGX for secure computation spaces, hybrid HE-MPC protocols for efficient distributed computing, and memory encryption with AMD SEV or Intel TDX for enhanced data protection.

- HE can also be integrated with Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE)[^ABE-homomorphic-encryption-developers] to allow fine-grained access control, ensuring that data access is granted only to users with specific attributes or roles. Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)[^IBE-homomorphic-encryption-developers] simplifies key management by allowing public keys to be derived from unique user identifiers, reducing the complexity of certificate distribution (Boneh, D., & Franklin, M., 2001). Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) provide anonymous authentication, allowing users to prove their identity or access rights without revealing any underlying sensitive information[^Goldwasser89-homomorphic-encryption-developers]. By combining these techniques, HE ensures that data remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle while still allowing flexible and secure access management, simplified key handling, and privacy-preserving authentication.

This layered approach ensures that HE is not deployed in isolation but rather as part of a comprehensive security architecture where each component strengthens the overall security posture. The combination of these technologies provides defense-in-depth while addressing specific threats at each layer of the infrastructure.

Real-world examples:

- Medical research: HE, when combined with AES-256 encryption and TEEs, allows hospitals to study patient data while maintaining privacy. Within the private cloud, patient data is securely stored using AES-256 encryption and processed within TEEs, while HE allows computations on encrypted data without decryption. For example, doctors can analyze medical images with patient details encrypted and isolated, enabling researchers to identify important patterns without seeing individual patient information. When data needs to be shared across institutions, SMC is used to ensure data privacy, thereby identifying effective treatments and new drug opportunities while ensuring patient privacy.

- Financial services: In the private cloud, financial institutions store customer data encrypted using AES-256 and conduct computations using HE combined with TEEs. TLS ensures data confidentiality when it moves in and out of the private cloud. HE, in combination with TLS for data in transit and TEEs for processing, helps financial institutions process banking information while keeping account details secret. Banks can use HE to assess loan applications by running risk analyses on encrypted financial data within TEEs, enabling automated decision-making without exposing customers' financial histories. This combination ensures data remains confidential throughout its lifecycle, from transmission to analysis.

- Defense sector: Within a private cloud environment, sensitive defense-related data is encrypted with AES-256 and processed securely using HE and TEEs. For example, a remote-controlled drone can perform target calculations using HE while ensuring that even if intercepted, the encrypted data and computations remain confidential, safeguarding operational integrity. Logistics data can also be analyzed collaboratively among trusted partners using SMPC without revealing the underlying sensitive information, ensuring data privacy and safeguarding national security interests. TLS and IPsec are used to protect data that enters or exits the private cloud, ensuring that no sensitive information is exposed during transmission.

#### Blockchain technology

Blockchain technology can be thought of as a digital ledger that everyone can seeâ€”like a giant spreadsheet that tracks transactions. The challenge is: how do you keep certain details private on this public ledger? It's similar to wanting to tell people you bought something without revealing how much you paid for it.

Blockchain technology is known for its transparency and security, which are useful for verifying transactions. However, this transparency also creates a privacy challenge. To address this, HE, ZKPs, and SMC are employed to protect sensitive information while maintaining the integrity and verifiability of blockchain data.

#### HE, ZKPs, and SMC

HE ensures that sensitive information remains protected throughout the process. In blockchain systems, this is crucial for maintaining privacy without compromising the ability to verify data integrity. For example, HE can be used to perform operations on encrypted transaction details, such as calculating total transaction amounts or processing smart contract conditions, enabling stakeholders to verify outcomes without seeing the underlying sensitive data. In privacy-focused Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum, HE can be applied to compute transaction fees or aggregate user balances in encrypted form, maintaining both privacy and scalability. Similarly, in blockchain-based supply chain systems, HE enables participants to encrypt transaction details before adding them to the blockchain, ensuring that sensitive information (like pricing or quantities) remains hidden while the overall process can still be verified by stakeholders. This privacy-preserving transparency is crucial in competitive environments, allowing stakeholders to verify product provenance without exposing confidential business information.

ZKPs are leveraged in blockchain to enhance privacy by allowing parties to prove that certain statements are true without revealing specific information. In supply chain scenarios, ZKPs can prove that specific procedures were followed or quality standards were met without disclosing proprietary details. This ensures compliance while maintaining confidentiality. In digital identity verification, ZKPs allow individuals to prove attributes of their identity (such as being of legal age) without exposing their full identity or birthdate, ensuring privacy and compliance.

SMC is leveraged to enable collaborative decision-making or data aggregation on the blockchain without exposing individual inputs. This is particularly useful in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms or voting mechanisms within decentralized governance systems. For instance, in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), SMC allows members to collectively compute outcomes (such as voting results) while keeping individual votes private, ensuring both transparency and privacy in the decision-making process.

Both HE and ZKPs aim to preserve privacy while proving computation correctness. They are often used together to enhance privacy in blockchain systems. For instance, HE can encrypt inputs while ZKPs prove the correctness of computations on these encrypted inputs. zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) can also be used to prove the correct execution of homomorphic operations, providing efficient and verifiable computations. Hybrid protocols that combine HE and ZKPs create efficient, private smart contracts where the correctness of encrypted computations is guaranteed without revealing sensitive information.

SMC and HE are complementary technologies for performing private computations on blockchain. HE can be integrated within SMC protocols to reduce the number of communication rounds required, leading to more efficient computations. Hybrid protocols that combine Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and SMC provide improved performance and security in blockchain applications. For example, SMC and HE are used together in threshold cryptography implementations to enable secure collaborative decision-making and private data aggregation, while ensuring sensitive information remains confidential.

#### Other cryptographic techniques

The following cryptographic techniques share a common foundation in supporting privacy-preserving, hidden but verifiable computations on blockchain. These methods are often combined to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in blockchain systems:

- **Commitment schemes and HE**: A commitment scheme[^Brassard88-homomorphic-encryption-developers] is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden from others, with the ability to reveal the value later. It ensures both secrecy and the ability to verify the commitment, which is essential for many blockchain applications. Commitment schemes and HE support hidden but verifiable computations on blockchain. Homomorphic commitments allow computations to be performed on committed values without revealing them, which can be combined with HE for verifiable encrypted computations. This combination is particularly useful in confidential transaction protocols, where participants need to commit to transaction values while still allowing certain operations to be verified.

- **Threshold cryptography and HE**: Threshold cryptography[^Desmedt94-homomorphic-encryption-developers] is a cryptographic approach in which a secret is divided into multiple parts, and a predefined number (or threshold) of those parts is required to reconstruct the secret. This approach ensures security by distributing control among several parties, reducing the risk of a single point of failure. In blockchain, threshold cryptography can be used for distributed key generation, ensuring that no single entity has full access to sensitive information, thereby enhancing security and resilience in systems like multi-signature wallets or decentralized voting. HE shares common mathematical foundations with threshold cryptography. Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE)[^Asharov12-homomorphic-encryption-developers] schemes allow distributed key generation and secure computations among multiple parties without revealing individual contributions. Multi-key HE is another application, enabling secure distributed computations while ensuring privacy. These techniques can also be used for shared decryption of homomorphically processed data, ensuring that no single participant can access the data in its entirety.

- **Ring signatures and HE**: A ring signature[^Rivest01-homomorphic-encryption-developers] is a type of digital signature that allows a member of a group to sign a message on behalf of the group, without revealing which specific member signed it. This provides anonymity for the signer while still proving that they are part of the group. HE and ring signatures are used together to support privacy-preserving operations on blockchain. For example, they can be combined to develop privacy-preserving voting schemes where votes are encrypted using HE, while ring signatures provide anonymity. They can also be used in anonymous credential systems where user attributes are encrypted, supporting confidential transactions without revealing individual identities.

#### Real-world applications

The integration of advanced cryptographic techniques into blockchain technology enables various real-world applications that enhance privacy, security, and transparency. Below are examples of how these techniques are used in practice:

- Supply chain management (Ethereum-based systems): In blockchain-based supply chain systems, HE can keep transaction details private while allowing stakeholders to verify the authenticity and origin of goods. For example, in a global supply chain where manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers contribute information about a productâ€™s journey, HE ensures that while the overall process can be verified, no sensitive information (like supplier pricing or quantities) is exposed to unauthorized parties. ZKPs further enhance privacy by allowing parties to prove they followed specific procedures or met quality standards without disclosing proprietary details. These technologies ensure compliance and transparency while maintaining competitive confidentiality.

- Digital identity verification (Algorand blockchain): HE is used to allow individuals to prove aspects of their identity without revealing unnecessary information. For instance, a person can prove they are of legal drinking age without revealing their birthdate using a blockchain-based identity verification system. ZKPs are also used in this scenario to validate identity attributes securely, ensuring privacy while maintaining compliance with regulations.

- Decentralized marketplace transactions (Ethereum Layer 2 solutions): Buyers and sellers in a decentralized marketplace can use HE to conduct transactions privately, keeping details like transaction amounts or account balances confidential. For example, a user buying digital art can make payments using HE, ensuring that neither the marketplace nor any third parties can access their financial details.

- Real estate transactions via Smart Contracts (Hyperledger Fabric): In a real estate transaction conducted through a smart contract, HE can be used to keep payment amounts and identities confidential while executing securely on the blockchain. This ensures compliance with local regulations while maintaining privacy for both buyers and sellers.

- Luxury goods supply chain (VeChain): A luxury goods manufacturer may use blockchain to track the journey of products from factory to retailer. HE would keep sensitive details like supplier pricing confidential while providing proof of authenticity to consumers. For example, a watch manufacturer might leverage HE to ensure that authenticity data is available to buyers while keeping internal processes private.

- Age verification for digital services (Cardano blockchain): Using HE, a user can prove they are above the legal age to access age-restricted products without revealing their full identity. A blockchain-based gaming platform could use HE to verify users' ages while protecting personal data from exposure.

- National election voting system (Tezos blockchain): In a national election using blockchain, HE keeps voter identities and preferences confidential while allowing an accurate vote count. Voters can cast their ballots online through a secure blockchain-based voting system, ensuring that individual privacy is maintained while the results remain transparent and trustworthy.

- DAO voting (Ethereum-based DAOs): In DAOs where members vote on proposals, HE allows each vote to remain encrypted while ensuring accuracy in vote counting. This is particularly useful for DAOs managing decentralized funds, where members vote on fund allocation without revealing individual preferences.

#### Secure data operations

Secure data operations involve different organizations working together with their data while keeping their individual information private. Imagine several companies wanting to know if they pay similar salaries without actually telling each other their exact numbers.

Secure data operations combine HE with other privacy-preserving techniques like SMC and DP. This allows different parties to collaborate, analyze data, and draw meaningful insights without revealing sensitive details. HE plays a vital role by ensuring data remains encrypted throughout the entire process, enabling computations to be performed while maintaining data confidentiality.

HE also enables new opportunities for collaboration in industries like finance, healthcare, and government, where maintaining data privacy is essential. Companies can jointly conduct market analysis, healthcare providers can collaborate on treatment research, and government agencies can securely analyze crime statistics without compromising individual privacy. These new collaborative possibilities can drive innovation and lead to more informed decision-making across sectors.

In the finance industry, for example, HE allows multiple financial institutions to collaborate on analyzing transaction data to identify potential fraud patterns without exposing customer details. Healthcare providers can use HE to jointly analyze medical research data to improve patient care while ensuring that patient identities remain confidential. Government agencies, such as law enforcement or public health departments, can use HE to safely share and analyze data from different jurisdictions to identify crime trends or track the spread of diseases without compromising individual privacy.

The use of HE in secure data operations is an important step forward, but it often requires combining multiple privacy-preserving technologies to achieve the desired level of security and functionality. While HE ensures that data remains encrypted throughout computations, SMC allows multiple parties to contribute to a computation without exposing their inputs, and DP adds noise to the results to protect individual data points from re-identification. Together, these technologies create a robust framework for secure data operations, enabling organizations to collaborate effectively while maintaining data privacy.

Real-world examples:

- Joint research projects: Joint research projects allow multiple organizations to analyze combined data while keeping individual data private. This is similar to several restaurants comparing their total sales without revealing individual restaurant earnings. Organizations can gain insights from combined data while keeping individual information secret. Universities across different countries could share encrypted research data to identify global health trends, such as the spread of a disease, while ensuring that the data of individual participants is kept confidential. For instance, researchers could use HE to analyze data from multiple healthcare providers to detect early warning signs of a pandemic without exposing patient identities.

- Private voting systems: Private voting systems count votes accurately while keeping individual votes secret. This is similar to putting marbles in a jarâ€”you can count the total without knowing who put which marble in. Everyone can verify the result while keeping their vote private. In local community elections, HE can be used to securely tally votes while ensuring that no one knows who voted for which candidate, maintaining voter privacy. This is particularly important in sensitive elections where voters may fear repercussions for their choices.

- Financial analysis: Financial analysis can be conducted across multiple banks without exposing customer data. It's like comparing average spending patterns without seeing individual transactions. Financial institutions can identify important trends while protecting customer privacy. Banks across different regions could collaborate to identify trends in fraudulent activities while ensuring that individual account details remain private and encrypted throughout the process. For example, using HE, banks can identify suspicious transaction patterns without exposing specific customer information, helping to prevent fraud and money laundering.

- Secure auctions: Secure auctions allow participants to place bids without the auctioneer seeing the bids until the end. Itâ€™s like everyone putting their bids in sealed envelopes that only open when determining the winner. The auction ensures fair results without exposing individual bids. In a government auction for land or resources, HE ensures that each bid is kept secret, leveling the playing field for all bidders while maintaining transparency during the final tally. This is particularly useful when bidders are competitors who need to keep their bidding strategies confidential while ensuring a fair and transparent process.

- Collaborative data analysis: Collaborative data analysis allows organizations to work together on data analytics projects without revealing their sensitive data. HE keeps the data encrypted while computations are performed, allowing everyone to benefit from the analysis. Organizations can cooperate securely without exposing individual datasets. Pharmaceutical companies could collaborate to analyze encrypted clinical trial data from multiple sources to improve drug development without ever seeing one another's raw data. This allows them to leverage a larger dataset to identify trends and efficacy more effectively, speeding up the development of new treatments while ensuring patient confidentiality.

- Cross-government data sharing: Government agencies often need to share data to address complex issues like public health or security. HE can be used to securely perform joint analyses without compromising sensitive information. HE allows encrypted datasets from different government departments to be analyzed without decrypting them. Agencies can draw insights from shared data without revealing sensitive citizen information. During a public health crisis, multiple health agencies across regions can use HE to combine and analyze data on infection rates, hospital capacity, and resource needs without exposing the personal information of patients. This ensures better coordination and response planning while maintaining strict privacy protections.

- Insurance risk assessment: Insurance companies need to assess risk based on a wide range of data, which may include sensitive personal information. HE enables encrypted data analysis, allowing insurers to assess risk without accessing the underlying raw data. Customers' sensitive personal data remains encrypted, ensuring privacy during risk calculations. Multiple insurers could share encrypted historical claims data to collaboratively develop better risk assessment models. By using HE, they can improve their ability to predict risks and set premiums without disclosing any specific customer information.

#### Private information retrieval

Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic technique that allows a client to retrieve data from a large database held by a server without revealing which specific piece of data is being requested. More formally, PIR ensures that the query sent by the client does not leak any information to the server about the data being retrieved, while still enabling the server to provide the correct response.

PIR is especially useful in situations where privacy is crucial, such as when accessing large public databases or confidential corporate data. It allows users to perform queries without revealing their interests or compromising their privacy. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential, even when interacting with third-party databases, thereby enhancing both security and user trust.

HE has had a profound impact on the evolution of PIR, particularly by enabling more efficient and practical implementations of single-server PIR schemes. HE allows computation on encrypted data without revealing the underlying plaintext, which means a server can process queries directly on encrypted requests, ensuring that the data and the query both remain confidential. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and security of PIR, as it removes the need for multiple non-colluding servers and allows for privacy-preserving data retrieval with a single server setup.

The integration of HE into PIR protocols leverages its ability to perform arithmetic operations on encrypted data, enabling the server to respond to client queries without ever decrypting them. This not only enhances the privacy guarantees but also makes PIR more scalable and practical in real-world applications. By using HE, single-server PIR implementations can efficiently compute responses to encrypted queries, minimizing computational overhead while maintaining strong privacy protections. In practice, tools like Microsoft's SEAL library incorporate HE, specifically Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE), to implement these capabilities.

PIR implementations generally follow two main approaches. The first is the Chor-Goldreich-Kushilevitz (CGK)[^CGK-homomorphic-encryption-developers] scheme for information-theoretic PIR, which provides unconditional security by distributing the database across multiple non-colluding servers. The second approach uses HE and lattice-based methods for computational PIR, which rely on cryptographic assumptions and typically operate with a single server. These lattice-based approaches leverage mathematical structures called lattices to create secure encryption schemes that allow efficient query processing while maintaining privacy.

The use of HE has fundamentally transformed single-server PIR, making it a more viable and efficient solution for privacy-preserving data retrieval. This combination of theoretical approaches and practical implementations has made PIR increasingly applicable across a wide range of privacy-sensitive scenarios, including its use in Private Set Intersection (PSI). The significance of HE cannot be overstated, as it not only strengthens privacy guarantees in PIR but also paves the way for other advanced cryptographic constructions, ultimately broadening the scope and utility of secure data retrieval solutions.

[^CGK-homomorphic-encryption-developers]: The Chor-Goldreich-Kushilevitz (CGK) scheme is an information-theoretic approach to Private Information Retrieval (PIR). It was proposed by researchers Benny Chor, Oded Goldreich, Eyal Kushilevitz, and Madhu Sudan. The CGK scheme ensures that a client can retrieve data from a database without revealing any information about which data is being requested. This method achieves unconditional privacy, meaning the privacy guarantee does not depend on computational assumptions but rather on the architecture of the system. In the CGK scheme, the database is replicated across multiple non-colluding servers. The client sends specially crafted queries to each server, ensuring that no single server learns which data is being retrieved. As long as the servers do not collude with each other, the client's privacy is preserved. The approach offers perfect privacy, but it requires the assumption that multiple servers are involved and that they do not share information about their interactions with the client. The CGK scheme is significant in scenarios where high privacy guarantees are required, but it comes with the practical limitation of needing multiple non-colluding servers, which may not always be feasible in real-world applications. See: Chor, B., Goldreich, O., Kushilevitz, E., & Sudan, M. (1998). **Private information retrieval**. _Journal of the ACM (JACM)_, 45(6), 965-981. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1145/293347.293350).

One notable example of PIR in action is its integration with Private Set Intersection (PSI)[^PSI-homomorphic-encryption-developers]. PSI allows two or more parties to find common elements in their datasets without revealing any additional information beyond the intersection itself. For instance, two companies may wish to identify common customers without sharing their entire customer lists. By leveraging PIR, each party can retrieve information about the intersection privately, ensuring that no non-intersecting data is exposed. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where maintaining the confidentiality of the datasets is crucial, such as in healthcare collaborations or financial partnerships.

(2004). **Efficient private matching and set intersection**. _International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT)_, 3027, 1-19. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24676-3_1). This reference covers foundational work on PSI, introducing efficient protocols for private set intersection and private matching.

Real-world examples:

- Patent database retrieval: A client can request a specific record from a large patent database without revealing which one they need. The client sends an encrypted index of the record, and the server processes this to return the encrypted result. For example, researchers can use PIR to access specific patents in the US patent database for a project without revealing which patents they are interested in. This ensures that sensitive intellectual property research remains confidential.

- Medical information retrieval: PIR allows a patient to retrieve a specific medical record from a hospital database without the hospital knowing which record was requested. For example, a patient undergoing treatment for a sensitive condition can use PIR to retrieve specific medical records without revealing their interest to the hospital staff, thereby ensuring full confidentiality. This approach is especially beneficial for patients dealing with stigmatized conditions, allowing them to maintain privacy while managing their health.

- Corporate data retrieval: Employees of a company can retrieve records from a confidential database without revealing which record they are looking for. For instance, an employee working on a confidential project could use PIR to access specific internal documents without revealing the nature of their query to the IT team, ensuring that confidential research remains secure. This is particularly important for organizations in competitive industries, where safeguarding project details and proprietary research is essential.

- Academic research collaboration: PIR enables multiple research institutions to collaboratively access sensitive datasets while maintaining the confidentiality of each request. For example, researchers studying sensitive health data across different universities can use PIR to collaborate on a large-scale study while maintaining privacy regarding their specific research interests.

- Customer support information retrieval: Customer service representatives can use PIR to access specific customer records without revealing which record is being accessed to unauthorized personnel. For instance, a representative could retrieve a customer's previous support history without the support platform's backend knowing which customer record was accessed. This helps maintain the privacy of sensitive customer information.

- E-commerce product information: PIR allows buyers to access specific product details from a large e-commerce catalog without revealing which product they are interested in. For instance, a user researching a high-value item can retrieve product information without revealing their interest, thereby preventing targeted marketing or price manipulation by the platform.

- Government records access: PIR enables citizens to access certain public records without the government knowing which specific record is being accessed. For example, a journalist researching a sensitive topic can use PIR to access specific government documents without revealing their focus, ensuring freedom of information while maintaining confidentiality.

- Intellectual property research: Legal teams or corporations can search through a database of patents or trademarks without revealing the specific intellectual property they are researching. For instance, during early stages of product development, a company can use PIR to verify patent details without competitors learning about their research interests, thus maintaining strategic confidentiality.

- Human resources record access: HR personnel can access specific employee records without revealing which record they are interested in to other departments or unauthorized personnel. For example, during an internal audit, an HR manager might need to review sensitive records without exposing which employees are being audited, ensuring privacy and avoiding unnecessary speculation.

- Legal document retrieval: Law firms often need to access specific legal documents from a shared database without disclosing which document they are searching for, especially during cases involving multiple parties. For instance, during a merger or acquisition, legal teams can use PIR to access critical contract details without tipping off competing firms about their focus, keeping negotiations confidential.

- Supply chain data access: PIR allows manufacturers to access specific supply chain information from a shared logistics database without revealing their focus to other stakeholders. For example, a car manufacturer may verify part availability without revealing to suppliers which model they are currently prioritizing, thereby maintaining competitive confidentiality.

- Market analysis for financial institutions: Financial analysts may need to retrieve specific market data from a large dataset without revealing which data points they are interested in. By using PIR, analysts can query the database and obtain encrypted results without disclosing their market focus. For example, an investment firm researching emerging markets can access key economic indicators without revealing their specific interests, thereby maintaining a competitive edge.

### Beyond HE

HE is a powerful tool in cryptography that has the potential to revolutionize data privacy. It allows computations to be carried out on encrypted data without requiring access to the original plaintext. This capability has significant implications for secure data processing, enabling cloud-based services to perform calculations on sensitive information while preserving privacy. However, despite its transformative possibilities, HE comes with several limitations and challenges that must be addressed before it can be widely adopted in practical applications.

Below, we outline some of the challenges and constraints associated with HE, providing a deeper understanding of its current limitations and the efforts needed to overcome them.

#### Challenges

1. Encrypted output: While HE allows for arbitrary computations on encrypted data, the outcome of these computations is still encrypted. This means that the result is only useful to someone with the secret key to decrypt it. For example, if a cloud server performs a complex computation on encrypted health records, the resulting encrypted output cannot be interpreted without the corresponding decryption key. This presents a challenge for practical implementations, as it requires data owners to perform decryption locally to understand the results. In contrast, other techniques like obfuscation and functional encryption enable certain types of encrypted computations where the output is directly accessible in plaintext. These techniques can be more practical in situations where immediate interpretation of results is required.
  Another drawback of the encrypted output is the lack of flexibility for collaboration. In many use cases, organizations need to share the results of computations with multiple stakeholders who may not have access to the decryption key. This means that HE, by default, limits the ease of sharing processed information unless additional mechanisms for key distribution are implemented. As a result, using HE often necessitates careful planning around how decryption keys are managed and shared, which can introduce additional security concerns. Managing key distribution securely while ensuring accessibility is an ongoing area of research in the field of cryptography.

2. Single key requirement: To perform computations on encrypted data, all inputs must be encrypted using the same key. This constraint limits scenarios where data from multiple sources, encrypted with different keys, needs to be jointly processed. For instance, in a scenario where multiple healthcare providers wish to collaborate on a dataset of encrypted patient records, each provider's data must be encrypted with the same key for joint analysis to be possible. This presents a significant barrier to collaboration, as coordinating the use of a single encryption key across multiple entities introduces security and logistical challenges.
  Addressing this limitation often requires the use of advanced key management techniques or trusted intermediaries, which can complicate the overall system architecture. Techniques like secure multiparty computation (SMC) can sometimes be used alongside HE to facilitate joint computations without sharing a common key, but these solutions tend to increase computational overhead and complexity. Moreover, the need for a single key also raises concerns about key compromiseâ€”if the key is exposed, all encrypted data becomes vulnerable, making key security a critical aspect of using HE in real-world applications.
  Researchers are actively exploring methods to allow computations on data encrypted with different keys, such as through key homomorphism or the use of proxy re-encryption. These approaches aim to enable interoperability between datasets encrypted with different keys, thereby enhancing the practicality of HE for collaborative applications. However, these methods are still in their experimental stages and are not yet widely adopted in mainstream cryptographic systems.

3. No integrity guarantees: HE allows for computations on encrypted data, but it does not provide a mechanism to verify that the computations were performed correctly. In other words, there is no inherent way to confirm if the resulting ciphertext is genuinely the outcome of the intended computation or if it is simply a new encryption of an unrelated value. This lack of integrity verification is a significant limitation, particularly in scenarios where the correctness of the computation is critical, such as financial transactions or medical data analysis.
  Without integrity guarantees, there is a risk that a malicious server could manipulate the computation process, resulting in incorrect outputs without detection. For instance, if a cloud provider intentionally or unintentionally alters the computation on encrypted financial records, the resulting encrypted output could be incorrect, leading to potential financial losses for the data owner. To address this issue, additional cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used in combination with HE to provide assurance that computations were performed correctly.
  Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that a computation was executed as expected without revealing any information about the input data. By integrating ZKPs with HE, it is possible to create a system where the server can provide verifiable proof that it performed the computation correctly. However, adding ZKPs to the process increases computational complexity and may impact performance, making it important to balance the need for integrity with the computational resources available.
  Another approach to ensuring the integrity of computations is the use of blockchain technology. By recording the steps of the computation on a blockchain, it is possible to create a transparent and tamper-resistant log that can be audited by all parties involved. This method, while promising, also introduces additional overhead and requires careful consideration of scalability, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

#### Future directions

In addition to the limitations outlined above, HE faces several other challenges that need to be addressed to make it more practical for widespread use. These challenges include:

1. Performance overheads: HE is computationally intensive compared to traditional encryption methods. Performing even basic operations on encrypted data can require significantly more processing power and time. FHE, which supports arbitrary computations, is particularly demanding and often impractical for real-time applications due to its high computational costs. Researchers are working on optimizing FHE schemes to reduce these performance overheads, but significant progress is still needed before they can be used in everyday applications. Advances such as bootstrapping optimizations and hardware acceleration are being explored to mitigate these challenges.

2. Large ciphertext sizes: Encrypted data under HE schemes tends to be much larger than the original plaintext data. This increase in data size, known as ciphertext expansion, can lead to storage and bandwidth issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets. For example, encrypting a simple medical record using FHE can result in a ciphertext that is several orders of magnitude larger than the original record. This makes storage and transmission of encrypted data more challenging, especially in environments with limited resources. Researchers are investigating techniques like compression schemes and more efficient ciphertext representations to reduce the overhead associated with HE.

3. Complexity of implementation: Implementing HE is complex and requires a deep understanding of advanced mathematics and cryptographic principles. This complexity makes it difficult for developers to integrate HE into their applications without specialized knowledge. To address this barrier, researchers and developers are working on creating libraries and tools that simplify the use of HE, making it more accessible to non-experts. However, there is still a long way to go before these tools are as user-friendly as traditional encryption libraries. Efforts like Microsoft SEAL, PALISADE, and other open-source libraries are helping bridge this gap, but more work is needed to make HE adoption mainstream.

4. Lack of standardization: Another challenge with HE is the lack of standardization across different implementations. Currently, there are multiple HE schemes, each with its unique properties, trade-offs, and performance characteristics. This fragmentation makes it difficult for developers and organizations to choose the right scheme for their needs and complicates interoperability between systems using different HE protocols. Ongoing efforts by organizations such as the HomomorphicEncryption.org community aim to create standardized benchmarks and guidelines to help users navigate the complexities of HE and choose the most suitable options for their use cases.

5. Key management and distribution: The effective management of encryption keys is a critical factor in ensuring the security of HE systems. As discussed earlier, HE often requires a single key to encrypt all data inputs, making key distribution a complex challenge, particularly in collaborative environments. If the key is compromised, all encrypted data becomes vulnerable. Key rotation mechanisms, secure key storage solutions, and the development of multi-key HE are all areas of active research to address these key management challenges. Proxy re-encryption and distributed key generation are also being explored as potential solutions to facilitate secure key sharing across different entities without compromising security.

6. Scalability issues: HE can be difficult to scale, especially for applications requiring large-scale data processing, such as big data analytics or machine learning. The computational overhead and increased data sizes make scaling HE to handle vast amounts of information a considerable challenge. Researchers are exploring the use of hybrid cryptographic solutions, where HE is combined with other privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and secure multiparty computation, to achieve a balance between scalability and privacy. These hybrid approaches can potentially make HE more viable for large-scale, real-time applications by distributing the computational burden and reducing latency.

## Basics

### Homomorphisms

Homomorphisms are an important concept in abstract algebra, referring to a function between two algebraic structures that preserves the operations of those structures. Simply put, if we have two sets, each with their own operations, a homomorphism ensures that operations performed on elements of the first set correspond directly to the operations on their mapped elements in the second set.

Consider two sets of numbers, Set A and Set B, where Set B is derived from Set A using a homomorphism function. If we take two numbers, 3 and 5, from Set A and add them to get 8, the homomorphism would ensure that their images in Set B, say 6 and 10, also add up to give the corresponding result, which is 16.

In formal terms, let Set A be represented by elements $a_1, a_2 \in A$, and Set B by their corresponding images under the homomorphism $f: A 	o B$. If $a_1 = 3$ and $a_2 = 5$, then:

$$
a_1 + a_2 = 8
$$

Applying the homomorphism $f$:

$$
f(a_1) = 6, \quad f(a_2) = 10
$$

Thus:

$$
f(a_1 + a_2) = f(a_1) + f(a_2) = 6 + 10 = 16
$$

This demonstrates how the homomorphism preserves the operation between the sets.

### Group properties in homomorphism
In abstract algebra, a set $S$ and an operation "$\star$" that combines any two elements $a$ and $b$ to form another element $a \star b$ qualifies as a group if the following properties hold:

- Closure: For all $a, b \in S$, the result of $a \star b$ is also in $S$. Example: Consider the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition $+$. If $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, then $a + b = 8 \in \mathbb{Z}$. The result is also an integer, demonstrating closure.

- Associativity: For all $a, b, c \in S$, $(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)$. Example: In the set of integers $$(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, addition is associative. For any integers $a = 3$, $b = 5$, and $c = 2$, we have:

  $$
  (a + b) + c = (3 + 5) + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10
  $$

  $$
  a + (b + c) = 3 + (5 + 2) = 3 + 7 = 10
  $$

  Thus, $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$, which shows that addition is associative.

- Identity Element: There exists an element $e \in S$ such that $e \star a = a \star e = a$ for all $a \in S$.
  
  *Example*: In $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, the identity element is $0$, as $0 + a = a + 0 = a$ for any integer $a$. For instance, $0 + 5 = 5$ and $5 + 0 = 5$.

- Inverse Element: For each element $a \in S$, there exists an element $b \in S$ such that $a \star b = b \star a = e$. Example: In $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, the inverse of an element $a$ is $-a$, since $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$, where $0$ is the identity element. For example, the inverse of $5$ is $-5$, because:

  $$
  5 + (-5) = 0
  $$

These properties ensure consistency and predictability in operations involving homomorphisms, making them a crucial aspect of algebraic structures.

## HE scheme

An encryption scheme is called homomorphic over an operation $\star$ if it supports the following property:

$$
	ext{Enc}(m_1) \star 	ext{Enc}(m_2) = 	ext{Enc}(m_1 \star m_2), \quad orall m_1, m_2 \in M
$$

where $Enc$ is the encryption algorithm, and $M$ is the set of all possible messages. This property means that performing the operation on encrypted data yields the same result as performing the operation on the plaintexts and then encrypting the outcome.

HE leverages the concept of homomorphism, as previously defined from abstract algebra, to allow operations on ciphertexts in a way that preserves the relationships between the original plaintexts. In a HE scheme, a function that operates on encrypted data will yield a result that, when decrypted, matches the result of the same function applied to the original plaintext data.

### Functional completeness

To create an encryption scheme that allows for the homomorphic evaluation of arbitrary functions, it is sufficient to support only addition and multiplication operations. Addition and multiplication form a functionally complete set over finite fields, meaning that any function, including Boolean functions, can be represented using combinations of these operations.

For example, any Boolean circuit can be expressed using only XOR (representing addition) and AND (representing multiplication) gates. Therefore, an encryption scheme that supports homomorphic addition and multiplication is capable of evaluating any Boolean circuit on encrypted data, making it fully homomorphic.

### Symmetric vs. asymmetric HE

A HE scheme can be designed to use either the same key for both encryption and decryption (symmetric encryption) or different keys for encryption and decryption (asymmetric encryption).

- Symmetric HE: In this case, the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. This approach is simpler but may have practical limitations, especially in multi-user environments.

- Asymmetric HE: Here, a public key is used for encryption, and a private key is used for decryption. This is more suitable for scenarios where data needs to be securely shared and processed by third parties, such as cloud computing.

### Key Components of HE

An HE scheme is primarily characterized by four operations: KeyGen, Enc, Dec, and Eval:

1. KeyGen: Generates a secret and public key pair for the asymmetric version of HE or a single key for the symmetric version. Key generation is crucial for establishing secure communication.

2. Enc (Encryption): Encrypts the plaintext messages. The encryption process ensures that sensitive data is transformed into ciphertext, which is unintelligible without the appropriate decryption key.

3. Dec (Decryption): Decrypts the ciphertext to recover the original message. Decryption ensures that only authorized users with the correct key can access the plaintext.

4. Eval (Evaluation): Takes ciphertexts as input and outputs a ciphertext corresponding to a function applied to the original plaintexts. The Eval function is the distinguishing feature of HE, as it allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without exposing the underlying plaintext. Eval performs the function $f$ over the ciphertexts $(c_1, c_2)$ without revealing the original messages $(m_1, m_2)$. The most crucial aspect of HE is that the format of the ciphertext must be preserved after evaluation to ensure correct decryption, and the size of the ciphertext should ideally remain constant to support an unlimited number of operations efficiently.

### Capabilities of Different HE Schemes

- PHE Schemes: Partially HE schemes support the Eval function for only one operationâ€”either addition or multiplication. They are less versatile but often computationally efficient for specific tasks. Examples include:

  - RSA: Supports multiplication as the homomorphic operation.
  - Paillier: Supports addition as the homomorphic operation.
  - ElGamal: Supports multiplication as the homomorphic operation.
  - Goldwasser-Micali: Supports XOR as the homomorphic operation.
  - Okamoto-Uchiyama: Supports addition as the homomorphic operation.

- SWHE Schemes: Somewhat HE schemes support a limited number of operations or can evaluate certain restricted circuits (e.g., branching programs). The accumulation of noise in ciphertexts restricts the depth of evaluation they can perform.

- FHE Schemes: Fully HE schemes support the evaluation of arbitrary functions (e.g., searching, sorting, max, min, etc.) for an unlimited number of times over ciphertexts. This capability allows complex functions to be evaluated securely, making FHE a powerful tool in privacy-preserving computations.
