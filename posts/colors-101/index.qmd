The evolution of color spaces is a testament to the intersection of art, science, and technology. Each color space has been developed to meet specific needs - from artistic expression and print media to digital interfaces and scientific research. Understanding these spaces is crucial for professionals in fields like photography, design, and digital media, where color accuracy and consistency are paramount.

## Color spaces

Let's break down the concept of a color space into simple terms first, and then delve into the technical aspects.

### Layman terms

Imagine you have a huge box of crayons with every color you can think of. A color space is like picking a smaller box from this huge collection. This smaller box contains a specific range of colors that you can use for a particular purpose, like drawing a picture or printing a photograph.

Just like you can't use the colors outside your chosen crayon box, a color space defines the range of colors (or 'gamut') that can be represented or reproduced in a medium, whether it's a computer screen, a camera, or a printed page. Different color spaces are like different sets of crayons, each suited for different tasks or equipment.
