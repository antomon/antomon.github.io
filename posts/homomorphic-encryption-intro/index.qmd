## Introduction

Imagine you‚Äôre building a healthcare app that needs to analyze patient data stored in the cloud. Since the data is sensitive, you encrypt it before sending it. However, every time you need to analyze the data, you have to decrypt it, which means the data is exposed and creates a security risk.

This is the main problem with traditional encryption systems like RSA and AES. They protect data while it's stored or sent, but as soon as you need to use the data, you have to decrypt it. It‚Äôs like keeping money in a safe but needing to take it out every time you want to count it. This fundamental limitation makes it challenging to keep sensitive information secure throughout its lifecycle, especially as more applications rely on cloud computing, where the need for remote processing is common.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) aims to solve this problem by allowing data to remain encrypted even while it's being processed. It promises to make the cloud much safer for storing and analyzing data, which could have far-reaching impacts on healthcare, finance, and many other fields. Imagine being able to calculate the average income of a group of people without ever knowing how much any individual earns, that's the promise of HE.

### The challenge with data security

Even when data is encrypted and stored in the cloud, there are still some risks:

1. Metadata exposure: Even if the data is encrypted, cloud providers can still see some information:

   - When the data is accessed.
   - How much data is being processed.
   - Patterns of usage that could reveal some details.

   Metadata may not contain the actual content of the data, but it can still provide insights that compromise privacy. For instance, frequent access to a medical record could imply a serious health condition, even if the actual diagnosis remains encrypted.

2. Trust issues: Cloud providers or intermediaries who have access to encryption keys could:

   - Access decrypted data when it's being processed.
   - Keep metadata even after the service ends.
   - Create privacy risks by storing information about data access, which could help them infer details even if the data itself is never fully decrypted

   These issues highlight the importance of removing the need to trust third parties. HE can help solve this problem by ensuring that data remains encrypted, even when it's being analyzed.

### Computing on encrypted data

HE is like a magic trick that lets you do math on data without ever actually seeing the data. Imagine helping someone count their money without them ever opening their wallet.

Let‚Äôs say a client has some data (x), and a server has a function (f). The client wants to know the answer to f(x):

- Traditional approach: The client has to share x with the server.

- HE approach: The client sends an encrypted version of x to the server, and the server does the calculations on the encrypted data.

How can you do calculations on encrypted data? This works because of something called **semantic security**. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. The encryption is random.

2. Encrypting the same input twice will give different results each time.

3. The result of a calculation on encrypted data is also encrypted and looks completely different from the input.

It‚Äôs like putting your data in a different locked box every time‚Äîeach box looks different, and no one can tell what‚Äôs inside just by looking at it.

This "magic trick" makes HE extremely powerful for situations where privacy is crucial. It allows sensitive information to be processed by remote servers without the risk of exposing the actual data. Imagine if healthcare providers could analyze patient data to find patterns for research, all while keeping every individual‚Äôs data private. HE could enable exactly that.

### How Does HE Work?

In traditional encryption, encrypted data can‚Äôt be processed in any useful way. It‚Äôs like trying to add two numbers written in totally different languages.

HE is different because it keeps the relationships between numbers, even when they‚Äôre encrypted. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

- Let‚Äôs say you have two numbers, $a$ and $b$.

- You encrypt them to get $E(a)$ and $E(b)$.

- With HE, you can add $E(a)$ and $E(b)$ and get an encrypted result that, when decrypted, gives you $a + b$.

This means you can perform calculations on encrypted data without having to decrypt it first. The ability to compute on encrypted data without decryption is what makes HE so revolutionary. In essence, it allows data to stay secure throughout its entire lifecycle, from collection to storage to processing.

HE works by using complex mathematical operations that preserve the structure of the data even when it's encrypted. The mathematics behind this is quite advanced, involving abstract algebra and number theory. These mathematical techniques ensure that operations such as addition and multiplication can be performed on the encrypted data in a way that yields correct results when decrypted.

### Types of HE

There are a few different types of HE, each with its strengths and limitations:

1. **Partially HE (PHE)**:

   - Supports only one type of operation, like multiplication.
   - Faster but limited in what it can do.
   - Useful for applications that require only a single type of computation, such as multiplying encrypted values to calculate totals in a secure manner.

2. **Somewhat HE (SWHE)**:

   - Supports both addition and multiplication but only up to a certain limit.
   - It‚Äôs like a calculator with limited battery‚Äîit works for a while but eventually stops.
   - SWHE can be useful when you need to perform a few operations, but it doesn't support unlimited computation. For example, it could be used in a scenario where only a fixed number of additions and multiplications are needed.

3. **Fully HE (FHE)**:

   - Supports unlimited operations on encrypted data.
   - This is the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù of encryption and was first discovered by Craig Gentry in 2009.
   - It can be slow and require a lot of computing power, but it offers the most flexibility.
   - FHE is the ultimate solution for privacy-preserving data processing, allowing for complex computations, such as machine learning algorithms, to be performed securely on encrypted data.

### How HE enhances private computing

HE can be combined with other privacy techniques to keep data secure while still being able to use it. These techniques are independent but can work well together with HE to achieve privacy goals:

- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: DP is a method that ensures individual data points in a dataset can‚Äôt be identified, even if the results are analyzed multiple times. By adding noise to the output, DP protects people's privacy while still allowing useful insights to be gained from the data. HE can be combined with DP to keep data encrypted during analysis, while DP adds another layer of privacy. For example, a healthcare company could use HE to compute encrypted patient data and add differential privacy to ensure that the output does not compromise individual identities.

- **Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)**: SMC allows several parties to jointly compute a result from their inputs without revealing those inputs to each other. HE is often used in SMC to make sure the data stays encrypted throughout the computation. This way, everyone can contribute without giving up their private data. For example, multiple banks could jointly analyze data to detect fraud patterns without sharing individual customer information.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: ZKPs are a way to prove that a statement is true without revealing any other information beyond the fact that the statement is true. ZKPs can be combined with HE to verify computations on encrypted data without revealing any sensitive information. This is particularly useful in scenarios like blockchain, where privacy and verification are both important. For instance, ZKPs could allow someone to prove they have enough funds for a transaction without revealing their exact account balance.

### Applications of HE

#### Public cloud services

Imagine a giant digital library that many people share‚Äîthis is essentially what a public cloud service is. Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Azure, or any Software as a Service (SaaS) application, such as email platforms, social networks, or collaboration tools, are examples where many users store and process their data in the same place. It's like having your personal locker in a public gym‚Äîwhile you have your private space, you're still using a shared facility. The more "layers" or services your data interacts with, the greater the privacy risks become, as each layer can potentially expose your data to further vulnerabilities.

The challenge with public clouds is keeping your information private while still being able to use all the helpful features they offer. Think about it like this: you want to ask someone to count your money, but you don't want them to see how much you have. That's where HE comes in: it lets the cloud service work with your data without actually seeing what's in it.

Public cloud services are used for various purposes, including data storage, file sharing, and running applications remotely. The privacy challenge in public cloud services is significant, as many users want the benefits of powerful processing without sacrificing the confidentiality of their data. HE offers a groundbreaking solution, allowing computations to be performed while the data remains encrypted. This means users can get useful insights and results from their data without exposing it to the cloud provider or any unauthorized third party.

HE enables users to make the most of public cloud services without giving up their privacy. For example, organizations can store and process customer information, health records, and financial data without ever exposing sensitive information. This capability makes public cloud services more secure and suitable for a wide range of applications involving confidential data. Additionally, HE can help governments, businesses, and individuals alike to harness the full potential of cloud-based services without the fear of privacy breaches.

Moreover, HE provides a way for SaaS applications like email platforms and social networks to perform useful functions on user data while maintaining privacy. For instance, an email service could filter spam emails or provide automated categorization features without actually accessing the content of your emails. Similarly, a social network could analyze user preferences to deliver targeted content or enhance user experience, all while keeping personal data fully encrypted.

When using SaaS applications, data often passes through multiple "layers" of services, each adding to the potential privacy risks. These layers could involve data storage, processing, and analysis, all of which need to be handled with the utmost care. HE mitigates these risks by ensuring that data is encrypted throughout its entire journey‚Äîfrom storage to computation. This makes public cloud services and SaaS platforms much safer environments for processing sensitive information, as the data remains encrypted at every stage.

Real-world examples:

- Navigation apps: Helps you find your way without revealing where you are. Imagine telling someone, "I'm somewhere in New York" and getting directions without revealing your exact street corner. The privacy benefit is that your location stays secret while still getting accurate directions. HE allows navigation services to process your location data while keeping the exact coordinates hidden, ensuring your privacy while still providing efficient route guidance. This is especially important for users who are concerned about sharing their real-time location with third parties.

- Health monitoring Devices: Your smartwatch or fitness tracker can process your health data securely. It's like having a doctor analyze your health charts while they're in a sealed envelope. You get health insights while keeping your personal metrics private. Imagine that a health service aggregates data from thousands of users' fitness trackers to find patterns in sleep quality. HE allows this analysis while keeping every user's specific sleep data private, so the service can improve recommendations without compromising privacy. This means that even if the cloud service processes millions of health records, individual users' data remains secure and confidential.

- Personal finance: Gets insights from your data without exposing the details. Similar to having someone tell you if your spending is normal for your age group without seeing your actual purchases. You learn from your data while keeping it confidential. A budgeting app could use HE to compare a user's spending habits against aggregate data to provide personalized recommendations, all while keeping individual transactions encrypted and secure. For instance, the app could analyze spending trends, identify areas for improvement, and suggest budgeting strategies‚Äîall without ever accessing your raw financial data in a readable form.

- Email filtering: Modern email services often use filters to identify spam, categorize messages, and even detect potential phishing attacks. With HE, these services can perform all of these operations without having to read the content of your emails. This ensures that your private messages remain confidential while still benefiting from advanced filtering and organizational features. Imagine an email provider categorizing your emails into folders such as Promotions, Social, and Primary‚Äîall without actually knowing what the emails say.

- Social networks: Social media platforms often use algorithms to suggest content based on user behavior. With HE, these platforms can analyze user interactions, such as likes, comments, and shares, to provide tailored content recommendations, all while keeping user behavior encrypted. For example, if a social network wants to recommend friends or content, it can do so based on encrypted data, ensuring that your activity and preferences are kept private.

- Collaboration tools: SaaS collaboration tools like document editors or project management software can use HE to provide enhanced features while keeping user data private. Imagine multiple users collaborating on a shared document, HE can ensure that the document remains encrypted while allowing authorized users to make edits and comments. This is crucial for businesses that need to ensure confidentiality while leveraging the benefits of cloud-based collaboration.

HE represents a transformative approach to data privacy, particularly in the context of public cloud services and SaaS applications. By allowing computations on encrypted data, it ensures that sensitive information remains secure even as it is processed. This groundbreaking technology not only addresses privacy concerns but also paves the way for more advanced, privacy-preserving cloud services that can be trusted by businesses, governments, and individual users alike.

#### Private cloud computing

Private cloud computing can be thought of as having your own personal digital vault, rather than sharing space in a public facility. It's like having a personal gym at home versus using a public one. This setup gives organizations more control, but they still need to ensure their information stays private during processing.

Private clouds are especially important for organizations handling highly sensitive information, such as hospitals, banks, or government agencies. These organizations often require dedicated resources to comply with strict regulatory requirements and ensure data protection from external threats. In a private cloud, HE helps keep data secure even during processing, adding an extra layer of privacy that allows data to be used productively without exposure.

However, even with private clouds, companies and their users are still vulnerable to software and hardware attacks, as well as risks related to personnel misbehavior. Software vulnerabilities could include flaws in operating systems or applications, while hardware attacks might involve compromised physical components or side-channel attacks. The human factor also plays a significant role‚Äîmisconfigurations, insider threats, or unintentional mistakes by personnel can compromise sensitive information.

To mitigate these risks, organizations must adopt a multi-layered security strategy that includes encryption, strong access control policies, employee training, and secure hardware components. Encryption is just one part of the overall security approach needed for a private cloud. Access control policies‚Äîsuch as two-factor authentication (2FA) and least privilege principles‚Äîhelp ensure that only authorized personnel have access to critical data. Employee training programs educate staff on security best practices and raise awareness of potential threats, while secure hardware solutions reduce the risk of physical attacks or hardware vulnerabilities.

HE plays a crucial role in enhancing data privacy and confidentiality in private clouds. However, it is essential to understand that HE is just one step in ensuring data privacy and security‚Äîit does not suffice on its own. Even with HE, additional security measures are needed to protect against vulnerabilities. Software and hardware are still susceptible to attacks, and personnel misbehavior can pose significant risks. A comprehensive approach that combines HE with robust access control, secure hardware, and continuous monitoring is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data. For instance, a financial institution may analyze customer data to determine creditworthiness or detect fraud patterns. By using HE, the institution can conduct these analyses without exposing customer information, maintaining a high level of privacy.

In healthcare, private cloud environments are used to store and analyze patient data. Hospitals and healthcare providers can leverage HE to process patient records, run predictive models for health risk assessments, and conduct clinical research‚Äîall while ensuring that patients' personal information remains confidential. For example, a hospital might use machine learning models to predict patient outcomes based on historical data. HE allows these computations to occur without exposing patient details, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.

HE can also enhance collaboration between organizations relying on private clouds. Consider two hospitals collaborating on a research study involving patient data from both institutions. Traditionally, sharing sensitive patient information requires significant trust and careful legal agreements due to risks of data exposure. By using HE, these hospitals can jointly perform computations on their combined datasets without sharing unencrypted patient information, enabling meaningful insights while keeping data secure and confidential.

Private cloud computing provides advantages for government agencies dealing with classified or sensitive information. For example, law enforcement agencies may need to analyze intelligence data from multiple sources to identify potential threats. Using HE, they can run analyses in a private cloud environment without compromising data confidentiality. Similarly, government agencies responsible for managing social programs could use HE to analyze citizen data while ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection laws.

However, while HE can address many privacy concerns, it is not a standalone solution. Private clouds still face various vulnerabilities that must be proactively managed. Regular software updates and patch management are crucial to mitigate risks from software vulnerabilities. Secure hardware components, like Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), can help protect against certain hardware attacks. Additionally, monitoring and auditing activities within the private cloud can help detect and respond to suspicious behavior, whether due to external attacks or internal misconduct.

Another critical aspect of securing private cloud environments is ensuring data integrity. While HE protects data confidentiality during processing, organizations must also take steps to verify that computations on encrypted data have not been tampered with. Techniques like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used alongside HE to verify the correctness of computations without revealing the underlying data. This is especially relevant in scenarios where data accuracy is crucial, such as financial modeling or medical diagnoses.

Real-world examples:

- Medical research: HE allows hospitals to study patient data while maintaining privacy. It's like doctors studying X-rays with patient names and details blurred out, enabling researchers to identify important patterns without seeing individual patient details. A pharmaceutical company could use HE to analyze medical data from hospitals across the country to identify effective treatments and new drug opportunities while ensuring patient privacy.

- Financial services: HE helps financial institutions process banking information while keeping account details secret. It's similar to having a financial advisor tell you if you qualify for a loan without actually seeing your bank statements. Banks can use HE to assess loan applications by running risk analyses on encrypted financial data, enabling automated decision-making without exposing customers' financial histories.

- Private data queries: HE enables secure searches through sensitive information, like asking someone to find a book in a library without telling them which book you're looking for. A private investigator, for example, could search a private database for criminal records using HE without revealing which names or records were queried, ensuring privacy for both the investigator and individuals in the database.

#### Blockchain technology

Think of blockchain as a digital ledger that everyone can see‚Äîlike a giant spreadsheet that tracks transactions. The challenge is: how do you keep certain details private on this public ledger? It's similar to wanting to tell people you bought something without revealing how much you paid for it.

Blockchain technology is known for its transparency and security, which are useful for verifying transactions. However, this transparency also creates a privacy challenge. HE helps make blockchain more private while keeping the benefits of transparency and security. It‚Äôs like proving you paid for something without showing your credit card details.

HE can solve many privacy issues within blockchain systems. For example, private information such as transaction amounts or user identities can remain hidden while still allowing verification by the entire network. This makes blockchain a powerful yet private solution for many use cases.

Blockchain technology is used not only for cryptocurrencies but also for a wide range of applications, from supply chain management to voting systems, and digital identity verification. Each of these use cases benefits from HE, which helps ensure that information processed on the blockchain remains confidential while allowing for transparent verification.

In blockchain-based supply chain systems, HE can keep transaction details private while allowing stakeholders to verify the authenticity and origin of goods. Imagine a global supply chain where manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers all contribute information about a product‚Äôs journey from raw material to finished good. With HE, each participant can encrypt their data before adding it to the blockchain, ensuring that while the overall process can be verified, no sensitive information (like supplier pricing or quantities) is exposed to competitors or unauthorized parties.

Another important use case for blockchain is digital identity verification. HE allows individuals to prove aspects of their identity without revealing unnecessary information. For example, someone might need to prove that they are of legal drinking age without revealing their birthdate or full identity. With HE, this kind of verification can be done securely on the blockchain, maintaining privacy while ensuring compliance.

Related concepts:

- Private transactions: HE keeps transaction details hidden while proving they're valid. HE allows users to make purchases while keeping the exact transaction amount private, and validators can confirm the transaction is valid without revealing sensitive details. In cryptocurrency networks, this capability is crucial for ensuring user privacy while maintaining trust in the network.

- Smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that automatically carry out the terms of a contract when predefined conditions are met. HE allows these contracts to execute while keeping details private. This capability is important not only for financial transactions but also for other use cases like automated insurance payouts, where sensitive information needs to be kept private.

- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)(DAOs): DAOs are groups governed by smart contracts where decisions are made collectively by members. HE can help keep individual voting decisions private while still ensuring that the final results are transparent and verifiable. This ensures that the decision-making process is both secure and fair, encouraging broader participation in DAOs since members can be confident that their individual votes remain confidential.

Real-world examples:

- Decentralized marketplace transactions: In a decentralized marketplace, buyers and sellers can use HE to conduct transactions while keeping details like transaction amounts or account balances private. For example, a user buying digital art can make a payment using HE, ensuring that neither the marketplace nor any third parties can access their financial details.

- Real estate transactions via smart contracts: A real estate transaction conducted through a smart contract can use HE to keep the payment amount and the identities of the buyer and seller confidential while still executing securely. For instance, an international property deal could be settled on the blockchain with HE, ensuring compliance with local laws while maintaining privacy.

- Luxury goods supply chain: A luxury goods manufacturer could use blockchain to track the journey of their products from the factory to the retailer. HE would keep sensitive information, like supplier pricing, confidential while still providing proof of authenticity to consumers. For example, a watch manufacturer might use HE to ensure that authenticity data is available to buyers while keeping internal processes private.

- Age verification for digital services: Using HE, a user could prove that they are above the legal age to access an age-restricted product without revealing their full identity or birthdate. For instance, a blockchain-based gaming platform could use HE to verify users' ages while protecting their personal data from exposure.

- National election voting system: In a national election using blockchain, HE can be applied to keep voter identities and preferences confidential while still allowing for an accurate count of votes. For example, citizens could cast their votes online through a secure blockchain-based voting system, ensuring that their privacy is maintained while the overall results are transparent and trustworthy.

- DAO voting: In a DAO where members vote on proposals, HE allows each vote to remain encrypted while still ensuring that the votes are accurately counted. For instance, in a DAO managing a decentralized investment fund, members could vote on where to allocate funds without revealing individual voting preferences.

#### Secure data operations

Secure data operations involve different organizations working together with their data while keeping their individual information private. Imagine several companies wanting to know if they pay similar salaries without actually telling each other their exact numbers.

Secure data operations combine HE with other privacy-preserving techniques like SMC and DP. This allows different parties to collaborate, analyze data, and draw meaningful insights without revealing sensitive details. HE plays a vital role by ensuring data remains encrypted throughout the entire process, enabling computations to be performed while maintaining data confidentiality.

HE also enables new opportunities for collaboration in industries like finance, healthcare, and government, where maintaining data privacy is essential. Companies can jointly conduct market analysis, healthcare providers can collaborate on treatment research, and government agencies can securely analyze crime statistics without compromising individual privacy. These new collaborative possibilities can drive innovation and lead to more informed decision-making across sectors.

In the finance industry, for example, HE allows multiple financial institutions to collaborate on analyzing transaction data to identify potential fraud patterns without exposing customer details. Healthcare providers can use HE to jointly analyze medical research data to improve patient care while ensuring that patient identities remain confidential. Government agencies, such as law enforcement or public health departments, can use HE to safely share and analyze data from different jurisdictions to identify crime trends or track the spread of diseases without compromising individual privacy.

The use of HE in secure data operations is an important step forward, but it often requires combining multiple privacy-preserving technologies to achieve the desired level of security and functionality. While HE ensures that data remains encrypted throughout computations, SMC allows multiple parties to contribute to a computation without exposing their inputs, and DP adds noise to the results to protect individual data points from re-identification. Together, these technologies create a robust framework for secure data operations, enabling organizations to collaborate effectively while maintaining data privacy.

Real-world examples:

- Joint research projects: Joint research projects allow multiple organizations to analyze combined data while keeping individual data private. This is similar to several restaurants comparing their total sales without revealing individual restaurant earnings. Organizations can gain insights from combined data while keeping individual information secret. Universities across different countries could share encrypted research data to identify global health trends, such as the spread of a disease, while ensuring that the data of individual participants is kept confidential. For instance, researchers could use HE to analyze data from multiple healthcare providers to detect early warning signs of a pandemic without exposing patient identities.

- Private voting systems: Private voting systems count votes accurately while keeping individual votes secret. This is similar to putting marbles in a jar‚Äîyou can count the total without knowing who put which marble in. Everyone can verify the result while keeping their vote private. In local community elections, HE can be used to securely tally votes while ensuring that no one knows who voted for which candidate, maintaining voter privacy. This is particularly important in sensitive elections where voters may fear repercussions for their choices.

- Financial analysis: Financial analysis can be conducted across multiple banks without exposing customer data. It's like comparing average spending patterns without seeing individual transactions. Financial institutions can identify important trends while protecting customer privacy. Banks across different regions could collaborate to identify trends in fraudulent activities while ensuring that individual account details remain private and encrypted throughout the process. For example, using HE, banks can identify suspicious transaction patterns without exposing specific customer information, helping to prevent fraud and money laundering.

- Secure auctions: Secure auctions allow participants to place bids without the auctioneer seeing the bids until the end. It‚Äôs like everyone putting their bids in sealed envelopes that only open when determining the winner. The auction ensures fair results without exposing individual bids. In a government auction for land or resources, HE ensures that each bid is kept secret, leveling the playing field for all bidders while maintaining transparency during the final tally. This is particularly useful when bidders are competitors who need to keep their bidding strategies confidential while ensuring a fair and transparent process.

- Collaborative data analysis: Collaborative data analysis allows organizations to work together on data analytics projects without revealing their sensitive data. HE keeps the data encrypted while computations are performed, allowing everyone to benefit from the analysis. Organizations can cooperate securely without exposing individual datasets. Pharmaceutical companies could collaborate to analyze encrypted clinical trial data from multiple sources to improve drug development without ever seeing one another's raw data. This allows them to leverage a larger dataset to identify trends and efficacy more effectively, speeding up the development of new treatments while ensuring patient confidentiality.

- Cross-government data sharing: Government agencies often need to share data to address complex issues like public health or security. HE can be used to securely perform joint analyses without compromising sensitive information. HE allows encrypted datasets from different government departments to be analyzed without decrypting them. Agencies can draw insights from shared data without revealing sensitive citizen information. During a public health crisis, multiple health agencies across regions can use HE to combine and analyze data on infection rates, hospital capacity, and resource needs without exposing the personal information of patients. This ensures better coordination and response planning while maintaining strict privacy protections.

- Insurance risk assessment: Insurance companies need to assess risk based on a wide range of data, which may include sensitive personal information. HE enables encrypted data analysis, allowing insurers to assess risk without accessing the underlying raw data. Customers' sensitive personal data remains encrypted, ensuring privacy during risk calculations. Multiple insurers could share encrypted historical claims data to collaboratively develop better risk assessment models. By using HE, they can improve their ability to predict risks and set premiums without disclosing any specific customer information.

#### Private information retrieval

Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic technique that allows a client to retrieve data from a large database held by a server without revealing which specific piece of data is being requested. More formally, PIR is designed to ensure that the query sent by the client does not leak any information to the server about the data being retrieved. This property is achieved through advanced cryptographic protocols, such as computational PIR or information-theoretic PIR, that prevent the server from learning anything about the client's request while still being able to provide the correct response.

Common algorithms used in PIR include the Chor-Goldreich-Kushilevitz (CGK) scheme for information-theoretic PIR and lattice-based approaches for computational PIR. Tools like Microsoft's SEAL library, Google's Private Join and Compute framework, and commercial solutions such as NTT Data's PIR implementation, Duality Technologies' SecureQuery platform, and Oracle's data privacy tools are also used to implement PIR efficiently. These algorithms and tools ensure that privacy is maintained without sacrificing performance, making PIR practical for real-world applications where privacy and efficiency are both critical.

Imagine the server is holding a massive collection, like the US patent database, and the client wants to retrieve one particular record without revealing which one it is. Using HE, the client encrypts the index of the record they want to retrieve. The server then performs a computation on the encrypted index to generate an encrypted result, which is sent back to the client. This computation is performed in such a way that the server never learns the content of the index or the nature of the data requested. Finally, the client decrypts the result to obtain the plaintext record they were looking for.

PIR is especially useful in situations where privacy is crucial, such as when accessing large public databases or confidential corporate data. It allows users to perform queries without revealing their interests or compromising their privacy. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential, even when interacting with third-party databases, thereby enhancing both security and user trust.

Real-world examples:

- Patent database retrieval: A client can request a specific record from a large patent database without revealing which one they need. The client sends an encrypted index of the record, and the server processes this to return the encrypted result. For example, researchers can use PIR to access specific patents in the US patent database for a project without revealing which patents they are interested in. This ensures that sensitive intellectual property research remains confidential.

- Medical information retrieval: PIR allows a patient to retrieve a specific medical record from a hospital database without the hospital knowing which record was requested. For example, a patient undergoing treatment for a sensitive condition can use PIR to retrieve specific medical records without revealing their interest to the hospital staff, thereby ensuring full confidentiality. This approach is especially beneficial for patients dealing with stigmatized conditions, allowing them to maintain privacy while managing their health.

- Corporate data retrieval: Employees of a company can retrieve records from a confidential database without revealing which record they are looking for. For instance, an employee working on a confidential project could use PIR to access specific internal documents without revealing the nature of their query to the IT team, ensuring that confidential research remains secure. This is particularly important for organizations in competitive industries, where safeguarding project details and proprietary research is essential.

- Academic research collaboration: PIR enables multiple research institutions to collaboratively access sensitive datasets while maintaining the confidentiality of each request. For example, researchers studying sensitive health data across different universities can use PIR to collaborate on a large-scale study while maintaining privacy regarding their specific research interests.

- Customer support information retrieval: Customer service representatives can use PIR to access specific customer records without revealing which record is being accessed to unauthorized personnel. For instance, a representative could retrieve a customer's previous support history without the support platform's backend knowing which customer record was accessed. This helps maintain the privacy of sensitive customer information.

- E-commerce product information: PIR allows buyers to access specific product details from a large e-commerce catalog without revealing which product they are interested in. For instance, a user researching a high-value item can retrieve product information without revealing their interest, thereby preventing targeted marketing or price manipulation by the platform.

- Government records access: PIR enables citizens to access certain public records without the government knowing which specific record is being accessed. For example, a journalist researching a sensitive topic can use PIR to access specific government documents without revealing their focus, ensuring freedom of information while maintaining confidentiality.

- Intellectual property research: Legal teams or corporations can search through a database of patents or trademarks without revealing the specific intellectual property they are researching. For instance, during early stages of product development, a company can use PIR to verify patent details without competitors learning about their research interests, thus maintaining strategic confidentiality.

- Human resources record access: HR personnel can access specific employee records without revealing which record they are interested in to other departments or unauthorized personnel. For example, during an internal audit, an HR manager might need to review sensitive records without exposing which employees are being audited, ensuring privacy and avoiding unnecessary speculation.

- Legal document retrieval: Law firms often need to access specific legal documents from a shared database without disclosing which document they are searching for, especially during cases involving multiple parties. For instance, during a merger or acquisition, legal teams can use PIR to access critical contract details without tipping off competing firms about their focus, keeping negotiations confidential.

- Supply chain data access: PIR allows manufacturers to access specific supply chain information from a shared logistics database without revealing their focus to other stakeholders. For example, a car manufacturer may verify part availability without revealing to suppliers which model they are currently prioritizing, thereby maintaining competitive confidentiality.

- Market analysis for financial institutions: Financial analysts may need to retrieve specific market data from a large dataset without revealing which data points they are interested in. By using PIR, analysts can query the database and obtain encrypted results without disclosing their market focus. For example, an investment firm researching emerging markets can access key economic indicators without revealing their specific interests, thereby maintaining a competitive edge.

### Beyond HE

HE is a powerful tool in cryptography that has the potential to revolutionize data privacy. It allows computations to be carried out on encrypted data without requiring access to the original plaintext. This capability has significant implications for secure data processing, enabling cloud-based services to perform calculations on sensitive information while preserving privacy. However, despite its transformative possibilities, HE comes with several limitations and challenges that must be addressed before it can be widely adopted in practical applications.

Below, we outline some of the challenges and constraints associated with HE, providing a deeper understanding of its current limitations and the efforts needed to overcome them.

#### Challenges

1. Encrypted output: While HE allows for arbitrary computations on encrypted data, the outcome of these computations is still encrypted. This means that the result is only useful to someone with the secret key to decrypt it. For example, if a cloud server performs a complex computation on encrypted health records, the resulting encrypted output cannot be interpreted without the corresponding decryption key. This presents a challenge for practical implementations, as it requires data owners to perform decryption locally to understand the results. In contrast, other techniques like obfuscation and functional encryption enable certain types of encrypted computations where the output is directly accessible in plaintext. These techniques can be more practical in situations where immediate interpretation of results is required.
  Another drawback of the encrypted output is the lack of flexibility for collaboration. In many use cases, organizations need to share the results of computations with multiple stakeholders who may not have access to the decryption key. This means that HE, by default, limits the ease of sharing processed information unless additional mechanisms for key distribution are implemented. As a result, using HE often necessitates careful planning around how decryption keys are managed and shared, which can introduce additional security concerns. Managing key distribution securely while ensuring accessibility is an ongoing area of research in the field of cryptography.

2- Single key requirement: To perform computations on encrypted data, all inputs must be encrypted using the same key. This constraint limits scenarios where data from multiple sources, encrypted with different keys, needs to be jointly processed. For instance, in a scenario where multiple healthcare providers wish to collaborate on a dataset of encrypted patient records, each provider's data must be encrypted with the same key for joint analysis to be possible. This presents a significant barrier to collaboration, as coordinating the use of a single encryption key across multiple entities introduces security and logistical challenges.
  Addressing this limitation often requires the use of advanced key management techniques or trusted intermediaries, which can complicate the overall system architecture. Techniques like secure multiparty computation (SMC) can sometimes be used alongside HE to facilitate joint computations without sharing a common key, but these solutions tend to increase computational overhead and complexity. Moreover, the need for a single key also raises concerns about key compromise‚Äîif the key is exposed, all encrypted data becomes vulnerable, making key security a critical aspect of using HE in real-world applications.
  Researchers are actively exploring methods to allow computations on data encrypted with different keys, such as through key homomorphism or the use of proxy re-encryption. These approaches aim to enable interoperability between datasets encrypted with different keys, thereby enhancing the practicality of HE for collaborative applications. However, these methods are still in their experimental stages and are not yet widely adopted in mainstream cryptographic systems.

3. No integrity guarantees: HE allows for computations on encrypted data, but it does not provide a mechanism to verify that the computations were performed correctly. In other words, there is no inherent way to confirm if the resulting ciphertext is genuinely the outcome of the intended computation or if it is simply a new encryption of an unrelated value. This lack of integrity verification is a significant limitation, particularly in scenarios where the correctness of the computation is critical, such as financial transactions or medical data analysis.
  Without integrity guarantees, there is a risk that a malicious server could manipulate the computation process, resulting in incorrect outputs without detection. For instance, if a cloud provider intentionally or unintentionally alters the computation on encrypted financial records, the resulting encrypted output could be incorrect, leading to potential financial losses for the data owner. To address this issue, additional cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used in combination with HE to provide assurance that computations were performed correctly.
  Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that a computation was executed as expected without revealing any information about the input data. By integrating ZKPs with HE, it is possible to create a system where the server can provide verifiable proof that it performed the computation correctly. However, adding ZKPs to the process increases computational complexity and may impact performance, making it important to balance the need for integrity with the computational resources available.
  Another approach to ensuring the integrity of computations is the use of blockchain technology. By recording the steps of the computation on a blockchain, it is possible to create a transparent and tamper-resistant log that can be audited by all parties involved. This method, while promising, also introduces additional overhead and requires careful consideration of scalability, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

#### Future directions

In addition to the limitations outlined above, HE faces several other challenges that need to be addressed to make it more practical for widespread use. These challenges include:

1. Performance overheads: HE is computationally intensive compared to traditional encryption methods. Performing even basic operations on encrypted data can require significantly more processing power and time. FHE, which supports arbitrary computations, is particularly demanding and often impractical for real-time applications due to its high computational costs. Researchers are working on optimizing FHE schemes to reduce these performance overheads, but significant progress is still needed before they can be used in everyday applications. Advances such as bootstrapping optimizations and hardware acceleration are being explored to mitigate these challenges.

2. Large ciphertext sizes: Encrypted data under HE schemes tends to be much larger than the original plaintext data. This increase in data size, known as ciphertext expansion, can lead to storage and bandwidth issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets. For example, encrypting a simple medical record using FHE can result in a ciphertext that is several orders of magnitude larger than the original record. This makes storage and transmission of encrypted data more challenging, especially in environments with limited resources. Researchers are investigating techniques like compression schemes and more efficient ciphertext representations to reduce the overhead associated with HE.

3. Complexity of implementation: Implementing HE is complex and requires a deep understanding of advanced mathematics and cryptographic principles. This complexity makes it difficult for developers to integrate HE into their applications without specialized knowledge. To address this barrier, researchers and developers are working on creating libraries and tools that simplify the use of HE, making it more accessible to non-experts. However, there is still a long way to go before these tools are as user-friendly as traditional encryption libraries. Efforts like Microsoft SEAL, PALISADE, and other open-source libraries are helping bridge this gap, but more work is needed to make HE adoption mainstream.

4. Lack of standardization: Another challenge with HE is the lack of standardization across different implementations. Currently, there are multiple HE schemes, each with its unique properties, trade-offs, and performance characteristics. This fragmentation makes it difficult for developers and organizations to choose the right scheme for their needs and complicates interoperability between systems using different HE protocols. Ongoing efforts by organizations such as the HomomorphicEncryption.org community aim to create standardized benchmarks and guidelines to help users navigate the complexities of HE and choose the most suitable options for their use cases.

5. Key management and distribution: The effective management of encryption keys is a critical factor in ensuring the security of HE systems. As discussed earlier, HE often requires a single key to encrypt all data inputs, making key distribution a complex challenge, particularly in collaborative environments. If the key is compromised, all encrypted data becomes vulnerable. Key rotation mechanisms, secure key storage solutions, and the development of multi-key HE are all areas of active research to address these key management challenges. Proxy re-encryption and distributed key generation are also being explored as potential solutions to facilitate secure key sharing across different entities without compromising security.

6. Scalability issues: HE can be difficult to scale, especially for applications requiring large-scale data processing, such as big data analytics or machine learning. The computational overhead and increased data sizes make scaling HE to handle vast amounts of information a considerable challenge. Researchers are exploring the use of hybrid cryptographic solutions, where HE is combined with other privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and secure multiparty computation, to achieve a balance between scalability and privacy. These hybrid approaches can potentially make HE more viable for large-scale, real-time applications by distributing the computational burden and reducing latency.
