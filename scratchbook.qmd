Let's put some formalism first. Let $(G, \bigstar)$ and $(H, \square)$ be algebraic groups. A group homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ is a function

$$f: G \rightarrow H$$

such that

$$f(x \bigstar y) = f(x)\square f(y)$$
$$\forall x, y \in G$$

As a simple example, take the two groups $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ and $(\mathbb{R}^+, \cdot)$, i.e. the real numbers with addition group and real positive numbers with multiplication group. Take the function $f(x)=exp(x)$, then $f$ defines an homomorphism with the two groups since

$$f(x+y)=e^{x+y}=e^x\cdot e^y=f(x)\cdot f(y)$$

# Homomorphism on the RSA <a class="anchor" id="RSA"></a>

RSA cryptosystem defines a homomorphism on $(\mathbb{Z}_p, \cdot)$ 

$$Enc: (\mathbb{Z}_N, \cdot) \rightarrow (\mathbb{Z}_N, \cdot)$$


Again, this cryptosystem has been explained in another notebook (I remind you though that here $N$ is a public parameter product of two randomly chosen primes $p$ and $q$).

We will test that:

$$Dec(Enc(m_x)\cdot Enc(m_y)) = m_x\cdot m_y$$
